    "## Online Travel Agency - Optimizing User Search Experiences \n",
    "Consider a leading online travel agency aiming to enhance its hotel ranking model. The travel agency trains the ranking model to predict the likelihood of a hotel being clicked or booked by a specific user. The improved model would consider factors like pricing, location, user reviews, and contextual details such as travel dates and user devices. This allows them to refine their search result rankings, making them more relevant to individual preferences. The net effect is that the traveling agency can increase booking rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth through a more personalized and efficient search experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 components to this travel agency scenario:\n",
    "-  **Search Ranking Model**\n",
    "    -  This Search Ranking Model provides the user with a list of top-ranked travel experiences.\n",
    "    -  The model tracks users' propensity to click and book the most relevant experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Chatbot Assistant**\n",
    "    -  This acts as an interface for the user to access the listing and book experiences via the chat interface instead of a manual search.\n",
    "    -  The chatbot uses the ranked trip options created by the **Search Ranking Model**.\n"
