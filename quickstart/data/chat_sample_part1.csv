Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model's behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

# How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

One approach for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs has on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

**Introduction**

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

## Point Explanation Methods: How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

**Introduction**

One strategy for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs have on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

Each feature is assigned a fraction of the prediction difference for which it is responsible. This fraction is called the feature attribution, and it’s what we show in our explanations.

Additive attribution methods have the following characteristics:

- The sum of feature attributions always equals the prediction difference.
- Features that have no effect on a model’s prediction receive a feature attribution of zero.
- Features that have the identical effect receive the same attribution.
- Features with mutual information share the attribution for any effect that information has on the prediction.

Additionally, each of these methods takes into account interactions between the features (e.g. two features that have no effect individually but in combination change the model output). This is explicitly built into the Shapley value formalism, and is captured in the path integral over gradients in Integrated Gradients.

**Shapley Values and their Approximation**

The Shapley value[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references) (proposed by Lloyd Shapley in 1953) is one way to derive feature attributions. Shapley values distribute  ",68,2024-04-19 23:01:49

Fiddler supports Integrated Gradients, which is an approximate attribution method that uses the gradient (slope vector) of a prediction to provide additional information. You can use this method to explain nearly any model by asking the model for predictions at different positions in the feature space. You can find more information about Integrated Gradients in the Fiddler documentation [here](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/global-explainability#integrated-gradients).",7718e0d7-be31-4eb0-9d99-31ff8c74c0c8,a07fdcc2-8b5b-4910-a7d5-fc7801cc56ba," slug: ""global-explainability"" https://www.fiddler.ai/slackinvite) to ask any questions_  "," slug: ""global-explainability"" https://www.fiddler.ai/slackinvite) to ask any questions_  "," slug: ""point-explanations""  space where distinct, individually relevant explanations might be important (e.g. “your loan application was rejected for a set of reasons when compared to applications in your region, and for another set of reasons when compared to applications with the same profession”).

Approximate Shapley value methods can be used to explain nearly any model, since you only need to be able to ask the model for predictions at a variety of positions in the feature space.

**Integrated Gradients**

Another additive attribution method: the Integrated Gradients method.

For models whose prediction is continuous and piecewise differentiable in the feature space, it can be useful to provide additional information through the gradient (slope vector) of a prediction.

Fiddler supports Integrated Gradients (IG)[<sup>\[4\]</sup>](#references). In this method, an approximate integral tabulates components of the slope along a linear path from baseline to explain-point, and attributes them to respective input features. This has several advantages:

1. For models with very high dimensional feature volumes (e.g. images, text), where differentiable deep-learning models typically excel, this method can be very performant (O(N) vs. the O(2^n) of the Shapley methods)
2. Attributions can be computed for intermediate layers within the model, providing fine-grained model diagnostics. This is naturally extensible to models with hybrid and multimodal inputs.
3. In comparison to local gradients and saliency methods, the IG path integral samples the large-scale behavior of the model and is resistant to amplifying noise in the possibly saturated region around the explain-point.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8e4f81-Tabular_Explain.png ""Tabular_Explain.png"")

A brief tour of the features above:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it's approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

**Two numbers** accompany each feature’s attribution bar in the UI.  "," ---

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model's behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

Please refer [our documentation](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/alerts) for more information on Alert Rules. 

---
  
Let's set up a few Alert Rules.

The following API call sets up a Data Integrity type rule which triggers an email notification when published events have 2 or more range violations in any 1 day bin for the ```numofproducts``` column.


```python
notifications_config = client.build_notifications_config(
    emails = ""name@google.com"",
)

client.add_alert_rule(
    name = ""Bank Churn Range Violation Alert1"",
    project_id = PROJECT_ID,
    model_id = MODEL_ID,
    alert_type = fdl.AlertType.DATA_INTEGRITY,
    metric = fdl.Metric.RANGE_VIOLATION,
    bin_size = fdl.BinSize.ONE_DAY, 
    compare_to = fdl.CompareTo.RAW_VALUE,
    #compare_period = None,
    priority = fdl.Priority.HIGH,
    warning_threshold = 2,
    critical_threshold = 3,
    condition = fdl.AlertCondition.GREATER,
    column = ""numofproducts"",
    notifications_config = notifications_config
)
```

The following API call sets up a Performance type rule which triggers an email notification when precision metric is 5% higher than that from 1 hr bin one day ago.


```python
notifications_config = client.build_notifications_config(
    emails = ""name@google.com"",
)
client.add_alert_rule(
    name = ""Bank Churn Performance Alert"",
    project_id = PROJECT_ID,
    model_id = MODEL_ID,
    alert_type = fdl.AlertType.PERFORMANCE,
    metric = fdl.Metric.PRECISION,
    bin_size = fdl.BinSize.ONE_HOUR, 
    compare_to = fdl.CompareTo.TIME_PERIOD,
    compare_period = fdl.ComparePeriod.ONE_DAY,
    warning_threshold = 0.05,
    critical_threshold = 0.1,
    condition = fdl.AlertCondition.GREATER,
    priority = fdl.Priority.HIGH,
    notifications_config = notifications_config
)
```

## 6. Publish production events

Information about your model is added to Fiddler and now it's time to start publishing some production data!  
Fiddler will **monitor this data and compare it to your baseline to generate powerful insights into how your model is behaving**.


---


Each record sent to Fiddler is called **an event**.
  
Let's load in some sample events from a CSV file.


```python
PATH_TO_EVENTS_CSV = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/main/quickstart/data/churn_events.csv'

production_df = pd.read_csv(PATH_TO_EVENTS_CSV)

# Shift the timestamps of the production events to be as recent as today 
production_df['timestamp'] = production_df['timestamp'] + (int(time.time() * 1000) - production_df['timestamp'].max())
```


```python
print(production_df['timestamp'])
```

You can use the client's `publish_events_batch` function to start pumping data into Fiddler!
  
*Just include:*
1. The DataFrame containing your events
2. The name of the column containing event timestamps


```python
client.publish_events_batch(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    batch_source=production_df,
    timestamp_field='timestamp',
    id_field='customer_id' # Optional
)
```

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

In the fraud detection example, Fiddler identifies a data integrity issue that caused the performance of the ML model to drop. By analyzing the point explanations, Fiddler identifies that the introduction of a new value in the ''Category'' column contributed to the model predicting cases as fraud incorrectly. This helps in understanding the root cause of the performance degradation and taking steps to mitigate the issue in the future. 

Reference URL: [https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/fraud-detection#step-7---actions](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/fraud-detection#step-7---actions)",a5edc979-e4b6-4133-bea4-4fbc253e1ec9,4596a3a0-b6bd-41fb-8deb-fee2796cab66," slug: ""fraud-detection""  produce a point explanation.

#### Step 7 - Actions

We discovered that the prediction drift and performance drop were due to the introduction of a new value in the ‘Category’ column. We can take steps so that we could identify this kind of issue in the future before it can result in business impact.

##### Setting up Alerts

In the ‘Analyze’ tab, we can set up alerts to notify us of as soon as a certain data issue happens. For example, for the case we discussed, we can set up alerts as shown below to alert us when the range violation increases beyond a certain threshold (e.g.-5%).

These alerts can further influence the retraining of the ML model, we can retrain the model including the new data so the newly trained model contains the ‘insurance’ category value. This should result in improved performance.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_importance`](ref:clientget_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `num_refs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_importance`](ref:clientget_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `num_refs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

**Projects** represent your organization's distinct AI applications or use cases. Within Fiddler, Projects house all the **Models** specific to a given application, and thus serve as a jumping-off point for the majority of Fiddler’s model monitoring and explainability features.

Go ahead and click on the _Lending project_ to navigate to the Project Overview page.

![](https://files.readme.io/b008f03-image.png)

Here you can see a list of the models contained within the Lending project, as well as a project dashboard to which analyze charts can be pinned. Go ahead and click the “logreg-all” model.

![](https://files.readme.io/f3e024d-image.png)

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform's core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Analyze_** — Analyze the behavior of your model in aggregate or with respect to specific segments of your population. Read the [Analytics](doc:analytics-ui) documentation for more details.
- **_Explain_** — Generate “point” or prediction-level explanations on your training or production data for insight into how each model decision was made. Read the [Explainability](doc:explainability-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Evaluate_** — View your model’s performance on its training and test sets for quick validation prior to deployment. Read the [Evaluation](doc:evaluation-ui) documentation for more details.

Two types of visualization are available:

- **_Word cloud_** — Displays a word cloud of top 150 words from a collection of text for this model. Fiddler provides three options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact's directionality.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**:  The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.
  - **Occurrences**: The number of times a word is present in the corpus of text.

- **_Bar chart_** — Displays the impact for the **Top N** words. By default, only words with at least 15 occurrences are displayed. This number can be modified in the UI and will be reflected in real time in the bar chart. Fiddler provides two options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact's directionality. Since positive and negative directionalities can cancel out, Fiddler provides a histogram of the individual impact, which can be found by clicking on the word.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**: The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.

The following image shows an example of word impact for a sentiment analysis model:

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model's behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it's approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

This notebook provides an example of how Fiddler enables monitoring and explainability for a ranking model. It uses a dataset from Expedia that includes shopping and purchase data with information on price competitiveness. The notebook demonstrates how to onboard a ranking model onto Fiddler and provides code examples for creating a `package.py` script to upload the model artifact.

Suppose you would like to upload a model artifact for a **ranking model**.

Following is an example of what the `package.py` script may look like.

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class ModelPackage:

    def __init__(self):
        self.output_columns = ['score']
        with open(PACKAGE_PATH / 'model.pkl', 'rb') as infile:
            self.model = pickle.load(infile)
    
    def predict(self, input_df):
        pred = self.model.predict(input_df)
        return pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=self.output_columns)
    
def get_model():
    return ModelPackage()
```

Here, we are assuming that the model prediction column that has been specified in the [`fdl.ModelInfo`](ref:fdlmodelinfo) object is called `score`.

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

![](https://files.readme.io/6442827-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.03_PM.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/f1dbcf6-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.15_PM.png)

You can also pass the above information to your Fiddler administrator via your okta.yml file. 

## Logging into Fiddler:

Once a Fiddler administrator has successfully set up a deployment for your organization using your given Okta credentials, you should see the “Sign in with SSO” button enabled. When this button is clicked, you should be navigated to an Okta login screen. Once successfully authenticated, and assuming you have been granted access to Fiddler through Okta, you should be able to login to Fiddler.

![](https://files.readme.io/c96a709-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.36.40_PM.png)

NOTES:

1. To be able to login with SSO, it is initially required for the user to register with Fiddler Application. Upon successful registration, the users will be able to login using SSO.
2. The only information Fiddler stores from Okta based logins is a user’s first name, last name, email address, and OIDC token.
3. Fiddler does not currently support using Okta based login through its API (see fiddler-client). In order to use an Okta based account through Fiddler's API, use a valid access token which can be created and copied on the “Credentials” tab on Fiddler’s “Settings” page.  ",19,2024-04-18 22:47:16

1. Connect to the Fiddler API using the FiddlerApi class and provide the URL, organization ID, and authorization token. You can find these credentials in the Fiddler UI under Settings.

   Example:
   ```python
   client = fdl.FiddlerApi(url=URL, org_id=ORG_ID, auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN)
   ```

2. Create a new project using the create_project function of the FiddlerApi class. Provide a unique project ID as the parameter.

   Example:
   ```python
   PROJECT_ID = ''my_project''
   client.create_project(PROJECT_ID)
   ```

3. Upload a baseline dataset using the upload_dataset function of the FiddlerApi class. Provide the project ID, dataset ID, baseline dataset as a pandas DataFrame, and a DatasetInfo object that contains information about the dataset.

   Example:
   ```python
   DATASET_ID = ''my_dataset''
   client.upload_dataset(
       project_id=PROJECT_ID,
       dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
       dataset={''baseline'': baseline_df},
       info=dataset_info
   )

Now just run the following code block to connect to the Fiddler API!


```python
client = fdl.FiddlerApi(
    url=URL,
    org_id=ORG_ID,
    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN
)
```

Once you connect, you can create a new project by specifying a unique project ID in the client's `create_project` function.


```python
PROJECT_ID = 'quickstart_xai'

client.create_project(PROJECT_ID)
```

You should now be able to see the newly created project on the UI.

## 2. Upload a baseline dataset

In this example, we'll be considering the case where we're a bank and we have **a model that predicts churn for our customers**.  
We want to explain our model's predictions and **understand the features that impact model predictions** the most.
  
In order to get explainability insights, **Fiddler needs to fiddle with your model**. To do so, we need to add your model details. This includes information about the data used by your model. So, we first start with uploading a small sample of data that can serve as a baseline.


---


*For more information on how to design a baseline dataset, [click here](https://docs.fiddler.ai/pages/user-guide/data-science-concepts/monitoring/designing-a-baseline-dataset/).*


```python
PATH_TO_BASELINE_CSV = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/main/quickstart/data/churn_baseline.csv'

baseline_df = pd.read_csv(PATH_TO_BASELINE_CSV)
baseline_df
```

Fiddler uses this baseline dataset to keep track of important information about your data.
  
This includes **data types**, **data ranges**, and **unique values** for categorical variables.

---

You can construct a `DatasetInfo` object to be used as **a schema for keeping track of this information** by running the following code block.


```python
dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(baseline_df, max_inferred_cardinality=100)
dataset_info
```

Then use the client's `upload_dataset` function to send this information to Fiddler!
  
*Just include:*
1. A unique dataset ID
2. The baseline dataset as a pandas DataFrame
3. The `DatasetInfo` object you just created


```python
DATASET_ID = 'churn_data'

client.upload_dataset(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    dataset={
        'baseline': baseline_df
    },
    info=dataset_info
)
```

If you click on your project, you should now be able to see the newly created dataset on the UI.

In order for Fiddler to monitor drift or data integrity issues in incoming production data, it needs something to compare this data to.

A baseline dataset is a **representative sample** of the kind of data you expect to see in production. It represents the ideal form of data that your model works best on.

*For this reason,* ***it should be sampled from your model’s training set.***

***

**A few things to keep in mind when designing a baseline dataset:**

* It’s important to include **enough data** to ensure you have a representative sample of the training set.
* You may want to consider **including extreme values (min/max)** of each column in your training set so you can properly monitor range violations in production data. However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).  ",176,2024-04-18 17:56:22

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

1. Data Drift: Monitor the drift in the distribution of features of interest using metrics like Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) or Population Stability Index (PSI). This helps identify distributional shifts in the data that could impact model performance. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/data-drift-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

2. Performance: Monitor model performance metrics specific to your model. This could include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Monitoring these metrics helps identify any decline in model performance. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/performance-tracking-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

3. Data Integrity Violations: Monitor data integrity issues such as range violations, missing values, or unexpected values in the data. This helps identify any issues that could harm model performance. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/data-integrity-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

4. Traffic: Monitor the volume of predictions made by the model. This helps understand the business impact of the model and identify any changes in the volume of decisions made based on the model''s predictions. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/traffic-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

By monitoring these metrics, you can assess the health of your model and identify any issues or changes that require attention.",d7d3ec1b-9426-4657-a700-36da76694dca,4911d382-bc41-412d-9834-d06eb8f9a6d4," slug: ""data-drift"" e-Monitor_DriftAnaly.png ""Monitor_DriftAnaly.png"")

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

Event publication is the process of sending your model's prediction logs, or events, to the Fiddler platform.  Using the [Fiddler Client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), events can be published in batch or streaming mode.  Using these events, Fiddler will calculate metrics around feature drift, prediction drift, and model performance.  These events are also stored in Fiddler to allow for ad hoc segment analysis.  Please read the sections that follow to learn more about how to use the Fiddler Client for event publication.  ",22,2024-04-18 8:14:33

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`run_feature_importance`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#client-run_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `n_inputs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Machine learning-based fraud detection models have been proven to be more effective than humans when it comes to detecting fraud. However, if left unattended, the performance of fraud detection models can degrade over time leading to big losses for the company and dissatisfied customers.  
The **Fiddler AI Observability** platform provides a variety of tools that can be used to monitor, explain, analyze, and improve the performance of your fraud detection model.

## Monitoring

### Drift Detection

- **Class-imbalanced Data** - Fraud use cases suffer from highly imbalanced data. Users can specify model weights on a global or event level to improve drift detection. Please see more information in  [Class-Imbalanced Data](https://docs.fiddler.ai/v1.3/docs/class-imbalanced-data). 

- **Feature Impact** - Tells us the contribution of features to the model's prediction, averaged over the baseline dataset. The contribution is calculated using [random ablation feature impact](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00174.pdf).

- **Feature Drift** - Tells us how much a feature is drifting away from the baseline dataset for the time period of interest. For more information on how drift metrics are calculated, see [Data Drift](doc:data-drift-platform).

- **Prediction Drift Impact** - A heuristic calculated by taking the product of Feature Impact and Feature Drift. The higher the score the more this feature contributed to the prediction value drift.

### Performance Metrics

Accuracy might not be a good measure of model performance in the case of fraud detection as most of the cases are non-fraud. Therefore, we use monitor metrics like: 

1. **Recall** - How many of the non-fraudulent cases were actually detected as fraud? A low recall value might lead to an increased number of cases for review even though all the fraud cases were predicted correctly.
2. **False Positive Rate** - Non-Fraud cases labeled as fraud, high FPR rate leads to dissatisfied customers.

### Data Integrity

- **Range Violations** - This metric shows the percentage of data in the selected production data that has violated the range specified in the baseline data through [`DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) API.
- **Missing Value Violations** - This metric shows the percentage of missing data for a feature in the selected production data.
- **Type Violations** - This metric shows the percentage of data in the selected production data that has violated the type specified in the baseline data through the DatasetInfo API.

## 3. Add information about your model

Now it's time to add details about your model with Fiddler. We do so by first creating a **ModelInfo Object** that helps Fiddler understand **how your model operates**.
  
*Just include:*
1. The **task** your model is performing (regression, binary classification, etc.)
2. The **target** (ground truth) column
3. The **output** (prediction) column
4. The **feature** columns
5. Any **metadata** columns
6. Any **decision** columns (these measures the direct business decisions made as result of the model's prediction)

```python
# Specify task
model_task = 'binary'

if model_task == 'regression':
    model_task = fdl.ModelTask.REGRESSION
    
elif model_task == 'binary':
    model_task = fdl.ModelTask.BINARY_CLASSIFICATION

elif model_task == 'multiclass':
    model_task = fdl.ModelTask.MULTICLASS_CLASSIFICATION

    
# Specify column types
target = 'churn'
outputs = ['predicted_churn']
decision_cols = ['decision']
features = ['geography', 'gender', 'age', 'tenure', 'balance', 'numofproducts', 'hascrcard', 'isactivemember', 'estimatedsalary']
    
# Generate ModelInfo
model_info = fdl.ModelInfo.from_dataset_info(
    dataset_info=dataset_info,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_task=model_task,
    target=target,
    categorical_target_class_details='yes',
    outputs=outputs,
    decision_cols=decision_cols,
    features=features
)
model_info
```

After ModelInfo object is created to save your model information, use the client's *add_model* call to add the generated details about your model. 

**Note:** You will need to specify a unique model ID.


```python
MODEL_ID = 'churn_classifier'

client.add_model(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    model_info=model_info
)
```

On the project page, you should now be able to see the newly created model. Notice how without uploading model or creating surrogate model, you can only explore monitoring capabilities.

    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/main/quickstart/images/xai_add_model.png?raw=true"" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## 4. Either upload your own model or generate a surrogate model

With the above step, your model is added to Fiddler which means that for a given *project_id*, your given *model_id* now holds *ModelInfo* about the model you care about. 

In order to be able to run predictions for explainability analysis, however, you will need to upload your model file. If you just want to explore the XAI capabilities without providing your model to Fiddler, you can also generate a surrogate model which tries to mimic your model based on the details provided. 

In this quickstart, we will go with generating a surrogate model based on the  ",37,2024-04-18 3:23:38

Fiddler offers an integration with Datadog which allows Fiddler and Datadog customers to bring their AI Observability metrics from Fiddler into their centralized Datadog dashboards.  Additionally, a Fiddler license can now be procured through the [Datadog Marketplace](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/tag/datadog-marketplace/). This [integration](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-machine-learning-models-fiddler/) enables you to centralize your monitoring of ML models and the applications that utilize them within one unified platform.

## Integrating Fiddler with Datadog

Instructions for integrating Fiddler with Datadog can be found on the ""Integrations"" section of your Datadog console.  Simply search for ""Fiddler"" and follow the installation instructions provided on the ""Configure"" tab.  Please reach out to [support@fiddler.ai](mailto:support@fiddler.ai) with any issues or questions.

The Fiddler Client provides methods for sending and receiving data to and from the Fiddler platform. You can connect to Fiddler directly from a Python notebook or automated pipeline using the Python Client provided by Fiddler.

To connect to Fiddler, you can use the `FiddlerApi` class from the `fiddler` package. You can pass the necessary information such as the Fiddler URL, organization ID, and authentication token directly into the function call. Here''s an example:

```python
import fiddler as fdl

URL = ''https://app.fiddler.ai''
ORG_ID = ''my_org''
AUTH_TOKEN = ''p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58''

client = fdl.FiddlerApi(
    url=URL,
    org_id=ORG_ID,
    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN
)
```

You can also authenticate with Fiddler by storing the necessary information in a file named `fiddler.ini`. This file should be stored in the same directory as your notebook or script. Here''s an example of writing the `fiddler.ini` file:

```python
%%writefile fiddler.ini

[FIDDLER]
url = https://app.fiddler.ai
org_id = my_org
auth_token = p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58
```

Once you have the `fiddler.ini` file, you can connect to Fiddler by simply creating an instance of the `FiddlerApi` class without passing any arguments:

```python
client = fdl.FiddlerApi()
```

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

![](https://files.readme.io/f1dbcf6-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.15_PM.png)

You can also pass the above information to your Fiddler administrator via your okta.yml file. 

## Logging into Fiddler:

Once a Fiddler administrator has successfully set up a deployment for your organization using your given Okta credentials, you should see the “Sign in with SSO” button enabled. When this button is clicked, you should be navigated to an Okta login screen. Once successfully authenticated, and assuming you have been granted access to Fiddler through Okta, you should be able to login to Fiddler.

NOTES:

1. To be able to login with SSO, it is initially required for the user to register with Fiddler Application. Upon successful registration, the users will be able to login using SSO.
2. The only information Fiddler stores from Okta based logins is a user’s first name, last name, email address, and OIDC token.
3. Fiddler does not currently support using Okta based login through its API (see fiddler-client). In order to use an Okta based account through Fiddler's API, use a valid access token which can be created and copied on the “Credentials” tab on Fiddler’s “Settings” page.  ",202,2024-04-18 1:27:16

A model is a **representation of your machine learning model**. Each model must have an associated dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring, explainability, and fairness capabilities.

You **do not need to upload your model artifact in order to onboard your model**, but doing so will significantly improve the quality of explanations generated by Fiddler.  ",60,2024-04-18 0:29:05
