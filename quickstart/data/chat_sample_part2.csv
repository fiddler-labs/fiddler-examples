First, you need to construct a `fdl.ModelInfo` object for the ranking model. This object includes information such as the project ID, dataset ID, model ID, model task, model features, target, outputs, and more. You can find an example of how to construct this object in the documentation.

Once you have the `fdl.ModelInfo` object, you can use the `client.add_model()` function to add the model to Fiddler. This function requires parameters such as the project ID, dataset ID, model ID, and the `fdl.ModelInfo` object.

Please note that when onboarding a ranking model, you must specify a `group_by` argument to the `fdl.ModelInfo` object. This argument tells Fiddler which column should be used for grouping items so that they may be ranked within a group.

For more details and examples, please refer to the [Ranking documentation](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/ranking).

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud's existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler's RESTful APIs.  "," ---

Model performance can be poor if models trained on a specific dataset encounter different data in production. This is called data drift. In the **Monitor** tab for your model, Fiddler gives you a visual way to explore data drift and identify what data is drifting, when it’s drifting, and how it’s drifting. This is the first step in identifying possible model performance issues.

![](https://files.readme.io/0d04342-Monitoring-DataDrift.png ""Monitoring-DataDrift.png"")

You can change the time range using the controls in the upper-right:

![](https://files.readme.io/d5809f8-Monitoring-TimeRange.png ""Monitoring-TimeRange.png"")

## What is being tracked?

- **_Drift Metrics_**
  - **Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD)**
    - A distance metric calculated between the distribution of a field in the baseline dataset and that same distribution for the time period of interest.
    - For more information on JSD, click [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon.html).
  - **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
    - A drift metric based on the multinomial classification of a variable into bins or categories. The differences in each bin between the baseline and the time period of interest are then utilized to calculate it as follows:

![](https://files.readme.io/0baeb90-psi_calculation.png ""psi_calculation.png"")

Here, `B` is the total number of bins, `ActualProp(b)` is the proportion of counts within bin `b` from the target distribution, and `ExpectedProp(b)` is the proportion of counts within bin `b` from the reference distribution. Thus, PSI is a number that ranges from zero to infinity and has a value of zero when the two distributions exactly match.

> 🚧 Note
> 
> Since there is a possibility that a particular bin may be empty, PSI can shoot to infinity. To avoid this, PSI calculation in Fiddler is done such that each bin count is incremented with a base_count=1. Thus, there might be a slight difference in the PSI values obtained from manual calculations.

- **_Average Values_** – The mean of a field (feature or prediction) over time. This can be thought of as an intuitive drift score.
- **_Drift Analytics_** – You can drill down into the features responsible for the prediction drift using the table at the bottom.
  - **_Feature Impact_**: The contribution of a feature to the model’s predictions, averaged over the baseline dataset. The contribution is calculated using random ablation feature impact.
  - **_Feature Drift_**: Drift of the feature, calculated using the drift metric of choice.
  - **_Prediction Drift Impact_**: A heuristic calculated using the product of the feature impact and the feature drift. The higher the score, the more this feature is likely to have contributed to the prediction drift.

In the Drift Analytics table, you can select a feature to see the feature distribution for both the time period under consideration and the baseline dataset. If it’s a numerical feature, you will also see a time series of the average feature value over time.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

## Model Artifacts and Model Package

A model in Fiddler is a placeholder that may not need the **model artifacts** for monitoring purposes. However, for explainability, model artifacts are needed. 

_Required_ model artifacts include: 

- The **[model file](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#model-file) **(e.g. `*.pkl`)
- [`package.py`](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#packagepy-wrapper-script): A wrapper script containing all of the code needed to standardize the execution of the model.

A collection of model artifacts in a directory is referred to as a **model package**. To start, **place your model artifacts in a new directory**. This directory will be the model package you will upload to Fiddler to add or update model artifacts. 

While the model file and package.py are required artifacts in a model package, you can also _optionally_ add other artifacts such as:

- [`model.yaml`](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#modelyaml-configuration-file): A YAML file containing all the information about the model as specified in [ModelInfo](ref:fdlmodelinfo). This model metadata is used in Fiddler’s explanations, analytics, and UI.
- Any serialized [preprocessing objects](#preprocessing-objects) needed to transform data before running predictions or after.

In the following, we discuss the various model artifacts.

### Model File

A model file is a **serialized representation of your model** as a Python object.

Model files can be stored in a variety of formats. Some include

- Pickle (`.pkl`)
- Protocol buffer (`.pb`)
- Hierarchical Data Format/HDF5 (`.h5`)

### package.py wrapper script

Fiddler’s artifact upload process is **framework-agnostic**. Because of this, a **wrapper script** is needed to let Fiddler know how to interact with your particular model and framework.

The wrapper script should be named `package.py`, and it should be **placed in the same directory as your model artifact**. Below is an example of what `package.py` should look like.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class MyModel:

    def __init__(self):
        """"""
        Here we can load in the model and any other necessary
            serialized objects from the PACKAGE_PATH.
        """"""

    def predict(self, input_df):
        """"""
        The predict() function should return a DataFrame of predictions
            whose columns correspond to the outputs of your model.
        """"""

def get_model():
    return MyModel()
```

The only hard requirements for `package.py` are

- The script must be named `package.py`
- The script must implement a function called `get_model`, which returns a model object
- This model object must implement a function called `predict`, which takes in a pandas DataFrame of model inputs and returns a pandas DataFrame of model predictions

### model.yaml configuration file

In case you want to update the custom explanations (`custom_explanation_names`) or the preferred explanation method (`preferred_explanation_method`) in the model info, you will need to construct a YAML file with **  ",90,2024-04-17 14:47:16

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud's existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler's RESTful APIs.  ",72,2024-04-17 13:49:05

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud's existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.

1. Workflow 1: User provided global class weights: In this approach, the user computes the class distribution on the baseline data and provides the class weights via the Model-Info object. The class weights can be manually entered by the user or computed from the dataset. This allows Fiddler to amplify the signals from the minority class and make it easier to detect drift in the minority class.

2. Workflow 2: User provided event level weights: In this approach, the user provides event level weights as a metadata column in the baseline data and provides them while publishing events. The weights are added as an ""__weight"" column in the model_info and the reference data. Events belonging to the minority class are up-weighted, while those belonging to the majority class are down-weighted. This approach also helps in detecting drift in the minority class.

You can find more information about these approaches in the [Class-Imbalanced Data](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/class-imbalanced-data) documentation.

## Monitoring class-imbalanced models

Drift is a measure of how different the production distribution is from the baseline distribution on which the model was trained. In practice, the distributions are approximated using histograms and then compared using divergence metrics like Jensen–Shannon divergence or Population Stability Index. Generally, when constructing the histograms, every event contributes equally to the bin counts.

However, for scenarios with large class imbalance the minority class’ contribution to the histograms would be minimal. Hence, any change in production distribution with respect to the minority class would not lead to a significant change in the production histograms. Consequently, even if there is a significant change in distribution with respect to the minority class, the drift value would not change significantly.

To solve this issue, Fiddler monitoring provides a way for events to be weighted based on the class distribution. For such models, when computing the histograms, events belonging to the minority class would be up-weighted whereas those belonging to the majority class would be down-weighted.

Fiddler has implemented two solutions for class imbalance use cases.

**Workflow 1: User provided global class weights**  
The user computes the class distribution on baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object.  
Class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset

- Please refer to the API docs on how to [specify global class-weights](/reference/fdlweightingparams)

- To tease out drift in a class-imbalanced fraud usecase checkout out the [class-imbalanced-fraud-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/blob/main/quickstart/Fiddler_Quickstart_Imbalanced_Data.ipynb)

**Workflow 2: User provided event level weights**  
User provides event level weights as a metadata column in baseline data and provides them while publishing events  
Details:

- Users will add an ""\_\_weight"" column in their model_info (must be a metadata type column, and must be nullable=True).

- The reference data needs to have an ""\_\_weight"" column, which may never be all null/missing/NaN  weights; all rows must contain valid float values. We expect the user to enforce this assumption.

- Note that the use of weighting parameters requires the presence of model outputs for both workflows in the baseline dataset.

Many ML use cases, like fraud detection and facial recognition, suffer from what is known as the _class imbalance problem_. This problem exists where a vast majority of the inferences seen by the model belong to only one class, known as the majority class. This makes detecting drift in the minority class very difficult as the ""signal"" is completely outweighed by the shear number of inferences seen in the majority class. 

This guide showcases how Fiddler uses a class weighting parameter to deal with this problem. This notebook will onboard two identical models -- one without class imbalance weighting and one with class imbalance weighting -- to illustrate how drift signals in the minority class are easier to detect once properly amplified by Fiddler's unique class weighting approach..

It is particularly useful for monitoring complex features that cannot be represented as a single number, such as text or image data. Users can define custom features by specifying a group of dataset columns that need to be monitored together as a vector. Fiddler then runs a clustering-based data drift detection algorithm for each custom feature and calculates a drift value between the baseline and the published events.

### Saved Model Updates

If you recently created or updated a saved chart and are not seeing the changes either on the dashboard itself or the Saved Charts list, click the refresh button on the main dashboard studio or within the saved charts list to reflect updates.

![](https://files.readme.io/706c198-image.png)

## Model Comparison

With our dashboard feature, you can also compare multiple models side-by-side, making it easy to see which models are performing the best and which may require additional attention. To create model-to-model comparison dashboards, ensure the models you wish to compare belong to the same project. Create the desired charts for each model and then add them to a single dashboard. By creating a single dashboard that tracks the health of all of your models, you can save time and simplify your AI monitoring efforts. With these dashboards, you can easily share insights with your team, management, or stakeholders, and ensure that everyone is up-to-date on your AI performance.

caedff78-37dd-46c1-9889-2a3bceacc2a4,,115,3.2264,0,,gpt-3.5-turbo,how can I customized my dataset schema?,7,"To customize your dataset schema, you can modify the `fdl.DatasetInfo` object. Here are the steps to customize the schema:

1. Load your dataset as a pandas DataFrame.
2. Create a `fdl.DatasetInfo` object by inferring the details from the DataFrame using `fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df)`.
3. Modify the schema as needed:
   - To modify a column''s value range, set the `value_range_min` and `value_range_max` of the column.
   - To modify a column''s possible values, set the `possible_values` of the column.
   - To modify a column''s data type, set the `data_type` of the column to `fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`.
4. Upload or publish the modified dataset.

For more details and examples, you can refer to the [Customizing Your Dataset Schema](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/customizing-your-dataset-schema) documentation.

It's common to want to modify your [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object in the case where **something was inferred incorrectly** by [`fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo-from_dataframe).

Let's walk through an example of how to do this.

***

Suppose you've loaded in a dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('example_dataset.csv')
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/3ffd956-example_df_1.png ""example_df (1).png"")

***

Suppose you create a [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object by inferring the details from this DataFrame.

```python
dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df)
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/571f9e4-example_datasetinfo.png ""example_datasetinfo.png"")

But upon inspection, you notice **a few things are wrong**.

1. The [value range](#modifying-a-columns-value-range) of `output_column` is set to `[0.01, 0.99]`, when it should really be `[0.0, 1.0]`.
2. There are no [possible values](#modifying-a-columns-possible-values) set for `feature_3`.
3. The [data type](#modifying-a-columns-data-type) of `feature_3` is set to [`fdl.DataType.STRING`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype), when it should really be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

Let's see how we can address these issues.

## Modifying a column’s value range

Let's say we want to modify the range of `output_column` in the above [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object to be `[0.0, 1.0]`.

You can do this by setting the `value_range_min` and `value_range_max` of the `output_column` column.

```python
dataset_info['output_column'].value_range_min = 0.0
dataset_info['output_column'].value_range_max = 1.0
```

## Modifying a column’s possible values

Let's say we want to modify the possible values of `feature_3` to be `['Yes', 'No']`.

You can do this by setting the `possible_values` of the `feature_3` column.

```python
dataset_info['feature_3'].possible_values = ['Yes', 'No']
```

## Modifying a column’s data type

Let's say we want to modify the data type of `feature_3` to be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

You can do this by setting the `data_type` of the `feature_3` column.

```python
dataset_info['feature_3'].data_type = fdl.DataType.CATEGORY
```

It's common to want to modify your [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object in the case where **something was inferred incorrectly** by [`fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo-from_dataframe).

Let's walk through an example of how to do this.

***

Suppose you've loaded in a dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('example_dataset.csv')
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/3ffd956-example_df_1.png ""example_df (1).png"")

***

Suppose you create a [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object by inferring the details from this DataFrame.

```python
dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df)
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/571f9e4-example_datasetinfo.png ""example_datasetinfo.png"")

But upon inspection, you notice **a few things are wrong**.

1. The [value range](#modifying-a-columns-value-range) of `output_column` is set to `[0.01, 0.99]`, when it should really be `[0.0, 1.0]`.
2. There are no [possible values](#modifying-a-columns-possible-values) set for `feature_3`.
3. The [data type](#modifying-a-columns-data-type) of `feature_3` is set to [`fdl.DataType.STRING`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype), when it should really be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

Datasets (or baseline datasets) are used for making comparisons with production data.

A baseline dataset should be sampled from your model's training set, so it can serve as a representation of what the model expects to see in production.

For more information, see [Uploading a Baseline Dataset](doc:uploading-a-baseline-dataset).

## What is being tracked?

![](https://files.readme.io/4a646d4-qs_monitoring.png ""qs_monitoring.png"")

- **_Decisions_** - The post-prediction business decisions made as a result of the model output. Decisions are calculated before [client.publish_event()](ref:clientpublish_event) (they're not inferred by Fiddler). For binary classification models, a decision is usually determined using a threshold. For multi-class classification models, it's usually determined using the argmax value of the model outputs.

- **_Performance metrics_**
  1. For binary classification models:
     - Accuracy
     - True Positive Rate/Recall
     - False Positive Rate
     - Precision
     - F1 Score
     - AUC
     - AUROC
     - Binary Cross Entropy
     - Geometric Mean
     - Calibrated Threshold
     - Data Count
     - Expected Calibration Error
  2. For multi-class classification models:
     - Accuracy
     - Log loss
  3. For regression models:
     - Coefficient of determination (R-squared)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
     - Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE)
  4. For ranking models:
     - Mean Average Precision (MAP)—for binary relevance ranking only
     - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

Dashboards in Fiddler are used to create comprehensive views of your monitoring data, including charts for data drift, traffic, data integrity, and performance metrics. You can add monitoring charts to your dashboards to track your model''s performance and make data-driven decisions. Dashboards allow you to analyze the overall health and performance of your models and compare multiple models. You can customize your dashboard view using filters such as date range, time zone, and bin size. You can also save, delete, or share your dashboard, edit base charts, and perform model-to-model comparisons.

On the other hand, PSI is used to collate specific visualizations under the Project Dashboard. It allows you to pin visualizations created using the Model Analytics tool to the dashboard and share them with others. PSI is part of the project structure and helps organize and present visualizations in a centralized manner.

**Projects** represent your organization's distinct AI applications or use cases. Within Fiddler, Projects house all the **Models** specific to a given application, and thus serve as a jumping-off point for the majority of Fiddler’s model monitoring and explainability features.

Go ahead and click on the _Lending project_ to navigate to the Project Overview page.

![](https://files.readme.io/b008f03-image.png)

Here you can see a list of the models contained within the Lending project, as well as a project dashboard to which analyze charts can be pinned. Go ahead and click the “logreg-all” model.

![](https://files.readme.io/f3e024d-image.png)

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform's core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.

Fiddler supports a wide range of strategies for routing HTTP traffic from end users to the Fiddler system. A typical on-prem Fiddler deployment includes an HTTP reverse proxy (Envoy) that can be configured as needed to meet your routing needs.

![](https://files.readme.io/fd4b216-image.png)

The diagram above shows some of the deployment configuration options related to routing and TLS, described below. Once Fiddler is installed in your on-prem environment, you may need to take  additional steps to route TCP traffic to the Fiddler Envoy service.

# TLS termination

By default, Fiddler does not perform TLS termination. We find that our customers generally have excellent opinions about how TLS should be terminated, and generally prefer to perform TLS termination using their own network machinery.

## Terminate TLS outside of Fiddler

In a typical production environment, TLS termination will occur outside of Fiddler. Clear HTTP traffic should then be routed to the Fiddler Envoy service at the port specified by `envoy.publicHttpPort`. 

```
envoy:
  terminateTLS: false
  publicHttpPort: ""80""
```

## Terminate TLS within Fiddler

Fiddler can be configured to perform TLS termination using an X509 server certificate and corresponding PKCS #8 private key. The TLS certificate must be valid for the FQDN via which end-users will access the Fiddler platform. Both the server certificate and private key must be available in DER format, and should be placed in a `Secret` within the namespace where Fiddler will be deployed prior to installation. For example:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret \
    --cert=path/to/the/cert.pem \
    --key=path/to/the/cert.key
```

The Fiddler Helm chart should be configured to reflect the `Secret` containing the server cert and key. TCP traffic should be routed to the port specified by `envoy.publicHttpsPort`.

```yaml
envoy:
  terminateTLS: true
  tlsSecretName: my-tls-secret
  serverCertKey: tls.crt
  privateKeyKey: tls.key
  publicHttpsPort: ""443""
```

## TLS with Ingress

Kubernetes `Ingress` [supports](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls) specifying a TLS secret on a per-ingress basis. If using an `Ingress` to route traffic to Fiddler, create a `Secret` containing the DER-formatted X509 server certificate and PKCS #8 private key in the namespace where Fiddler will be deployed:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret \
    --cert=path/to/the/cert.pem \
    --key=path/to/the/cert.key
```

The Fiddler Helm chart should be configured to enable Ingress with TLS. For example:

```
envoy:
  createIngress: true

ingress:
  tls:
    hosts:
      # The FQDN where Fiddler is accessed by end users.
      - fiddler.acme.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret
```

# Ingress

If the cluster where Fiddler is installed supports `Ingress`, the Fiddler Helm chart  ",17,2024-04-16 8:43:38

Here are the steps to upload multiple events:

1. Create a pandas DataFrame containing the batch of events you want to upload.
2. Use the `client.publish_events_batch` method and provide the following parameters:
   - `project_id`: The unique identifier for the project.
   - `model_id`: A unique identifier for the model.
   - `batch_source`: Either a pandas DataFrame containing the batch of events or the path to a file containing the batch of events.
   - `id_field` (optional): The field containing event IDs for events in the batch. If not specified, Fiddler will generate its own ID.
   - `update_event` (optional): If set to True, will only modify an existing event referenced by the ID field. If an ID is provided for which there is no event, no change will take place.
   - `timestamp_field` (optional): The field containing timestamps for events in the batch. If not specified, the current time will be used.
   - `timestamp_format` (optional): The format of the timestamp passed in the timestamp field. It can be one of the following: `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.INFER`, `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.EPOCH_MILLISECONDS`, `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.EPOCH_SECONDS`, `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.ISO_8601`.
   - `data_source` (optional): The location of the data source provided. By default, Fiddler will try to infer the value.

For more details and examples, you can refer to the [client.publish_events_batch](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/clientpublish_events_batch) documentation.

Fiddler allows you to publish a single file containing events for multiple models using one API call.

To do this, you can include conditional keys in the schema, which can be used to tell Fiddler which project/model to publish to.

Here's an example of what these conditionals looks like within a schema:

            ""model_output"": ""column6"",
            ""model_target"": ""column7""
        },

        ""!example_project_1,example_model_2"": {
            ""feature0"": ""column4"",
            ""feature1"": ""column5"",
            ""model_output"": ""column6"",
            ""model_target"": ""column7""

Supervised machine learning involves identifying a predictive task, finding data to enable that task, and building a model using that data. 

Fiddler captures this workflow with **project**, **dataset**, and **model** entities.

## Project

In Fiddler, a project is essentially a parent folder that hosts one or more **model** (s) for the ML task (e.g. A Project HousePredict for predicting house prices will LinearRegression-HousePredict, RandomForest-HousePredict).

## Models

A model in Fiddler represents a **placeholder** for a machine-learning model. It's a placeholder because we may not need the **[model artifacts](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#Model-Artifacts)**. Instead, we may just need adequate [information about the model](ref:fdlmodelinfo) in order to monitor model-specific data. 

> 📘 Info
> 
> You can [upload your model artifacts](https://dash.readme.com/project/fiddler/v1.6/docs/uploading-model-artifacts) to Fiddler to unlock high-fidelity explainability for your model. However, it is not required. If you do not wish to upload your artifact but want to explore explainability with Fiddler, we can build a [**surrogate model**](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#surrogate-model) on the backend to be used in place of your artifact.

## Datasets

A dataset in Fiddler is a data table containing [information about data](ref:fdldatasetinfo) such as **features**, **model outputs**, and a **target** for machine learning models. Optionally, you can also upload **metadata** and “**decision**” columns, which can be used to segment the dataset for analyses, track business decisions, and work as protected attributes in bias-related workflows. 

In order to monitor **production data**, a [dataset must be uploaded](ref:clientupload_dataset) to be used as a **baseline** for making comparisons. This baseline dataset should be sampled from your model's **training data**. The sample should be unbiased and should faithfully capture moments of the parent distribution. Further, values appearing in the baseline dataset's columns should be representative of their entire ranges within the complete training dataset.

**Datasets are used by Fiddler in the following ways:**

1. As a reference for [drift calculations](doc:data-drift-platform) and [data integrity violations ](doc:data-integrity-platform)on the **[Monitor](doc:monitoring-ui)** page
2. To train a model to be used as a [surrogate](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#surrogate-model) when using [`add_model_surrogate`](/reference/clientadd_model_surrogate)
3. For computing model performance metrics globally on the **[Evaluate](doc:evaluation-ui)** page, or on slices on the **[Analyze](doc:analytics-ui)** page
4. As a reference for explainability algorithms (e.g. partial dependence plots, permutation feature impact, approximate Shapley values, and ICE plots).

Based on the above uses, _datasets with sizes much in excess of 10K rows are often unnecessary_ and can lead to excessive upload, precomputation, and query times. That being said, here are some situations where larger datasets may be desirable:

Fiddler currently supports four model tasks. These include:

- Binary Classification
- Multi-class Classification
- Regression
- Ranking

**Binary classification** is the task of classifying the elements of an outcome set into two groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical binary classification problems include:

- Determining whether a customer will churn or not. Here the outcome set has two outcomes: The customer will churn or the customer will not. Further, the outcome can only belong to either of the two classes.
- Determining whether a patient has a disease or not. Here the outcome set has two outcomes: the patient has the disease or does not.

**Multiclass classification** is the task of classifying the elements of an outcome set into three or more groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical multiclass classification problems include:

- Determining whether an image is a cat, a dog, or a bird. Here the outcome set has more than two outcomes. Further, the image can only be determined to be one of the three outcomes and it's thus a multiclass classification problem.

**Regression** is the task of predicting a continuous numeric quantity. Typical regression problems include:

- Determining the average home price based on a given set of housing related features such as it's square footage, number of beds and bath, it's location etc.
- Determining the income of an individual based on features such as their age, work location, their job sector etc.

**Ranking** is the task of constructing a rank ordered list of items given a particular query that seeks some information. Typical ranking problems include:

- Ranking documents in information retrieval systems.
- Ranking relevancy of advertisements based on user search queries.  ",29,2024-04-16 4:50:55

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud's existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler's RESTful APIs.  "," ---

This page enumerates the new features and updates in Release 23.2 of the Fiddler platform.

## Release of Fiddler platform version 23.2:

- Support for uploading multiple baselines to a model

- Alert context overlay on the chart editor

- Ability to customize scale and range of y-axis on the chart editor

## What's New and Improved:

- **Support for uploading multiple baselines**
  - Flexibility to add baseline datasets or use production data as the baseline.
  - Perform comparisons amongst multiple baselines to understand how different baselines — data shifts due seasonality or geography for example — may influence model drift and model behavior.
  - Learn more on the [Baselines Platform Guide](doc:fiddler-baselines).

- **Alert context overlay on the chart editor**
  - For absolute alerts, alert context is an overlay on the chart area to easily identify critical and warning thresholds.
  - For relative alerts, Fiddler will automatically plot historic comparison data for additional context on why the alert fired.

- **Customization in the chart editor**
  - Further customize charts by toggling between logarithmic and linear scale, and manually setting the min and max values of the y-axis.
  - Learn more on the [Monitoring Charts](doc:monitoring-charts-ui) page.
