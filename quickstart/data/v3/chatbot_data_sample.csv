A model needs a baseline dataset for comparing its performance and identifying any degradation. A baseline is a set of reference data that is used to compare with our current data. 

The dataset that was used to train the model is often a good starting point for a baseline. For more in-depth analysis, we may want to use a specific time period or a rolling window of production events. 

In Fiddler, **the default baseline for all monitoring metrics is the training dataset **that was associated with the model during registration. Use this default baseline if you do not anticipate any differences between training and production. [New baselines can be added to existing models using the Python client APIs](ref:add_baseline).

In order for Fiddler to monitor drift or data integrity issues in incoming production data, it needs something to compare this data to.

A baseline dataset is a **representative sample** of the kind of data you expect to see in production. It represents the ideal form of data that your model works best on.

*For this reason,* ***it should be sampled from your model’s training set.***

***

**A few things to keep in mind when designing a baseline dataset:**

* It’s important to include **enough data** to ensure you have a representative sample of the training set.
* You may want to consider **including extreme values (min/max)** of each column in your training set so you can properly monitor range violations in production data. However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).  Document:  ---

This page enumerates the new features and updates in Release 23.2 of the Fiddler platform.

## Release of Fiddler platform version 23.2:

- Support for uploading multiple baselines to a model

- Alert context overlay on the chart editor

- Ability to customize scale and range of y-axis on the chart editor

## What''s New and Improved:

- **Support for uploading multiple baselines**
  - Flexibility to add baseline datasets or use production data as the baseline.
  - Perform comparisons amongst multiple baselines to understand how different baselines — data shifts due seasonality or geography for example — may influence model drift and model behavior.
  - Learn more on the [Baselines Platform Guide](doc:fiddler-baselines).

- **Alert context overlay on the chart editor**
  - For absolute alerts, alert context is an overlay on the chart area to easily identify critical and warning thresholds.
  - For relative alerts, Fiddler will automatically plot historic comparison data for additional context on why the alert fired.

- **Customization in the chart editor**
  - Further customize charts by toggling between logarithmic and linear scale, and manually setting the min and max values of the y-axis.
  - Learn more on the [Monitoring Charts](doc:monitoring-charts-ui) page.

### Client Version

Client version 1.8 is required for the updates and features mentioned in this release.  Document:  ---

**A few things to keep in mind when designing a baseline dataset:**

* It’s important to include **enough data** to ensure you have a representative sample of the training set.
* You may want to consider **including extreme values (min/max)** of each column in your training set so you can properly monitor range violations in production data. However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler currently supports four model tasks. These include:

- Binary Classification
- Multi-class Classification
- Regression
- Ranking

**Binary classification** is the task of classifying the elements of an outcome set into two groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical binary classification problems include:

- Determining whether a customer will churn or not. Here the outcome set has two outcomes: The customer will churn or the customer will not. Further, the outcome can only belong to either of the two classes.
- Determining whether a patient has a disease or not. Here the outcome set has two outcomes: the patient has the disease or does not.

**Multiclass classification** is the task of classifying the elements of an outcome set into three or more groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical multiclass classification problems include:

- Determining whether an image is a cat, a dog, or a bird. Here the outcome set has more than two outcomes. Further, the image can only be determined to be one of the three outcomes and it''s thus a multiclass classification problem.

**Regression** is the task of predicting a continuous numeric quantity. Typical regression problems include:

- Determining the average home price based on a given set of housing related features such as it''s square footage, number of beds and bath, it''s location etc.
- Determining the income of an individual based on features such as their age, work location, their job sector etc.

**Ranking** is the task of constructing a rank ordered list of items given a particular query that seeks some information. Typical ranking problems include:

- Ranking documents in information retrieval systems.
- Ranking relevancy of advertisements based on user search queries.  Document:  ---

Supervised machine learning involves identifying a predictive task, finding data to enable that task, and building a model using that data. 

Fiddler captures this workflow with **project**, **dataset**, and **model** entities.

## Project

In Fiddler, a project is essentially a parent folder that hosts one or more **model** (s) for the ML task (e.g. A Project HousePredict for predicting house prices will LinearRegression-HousePredict, RandomForest-HousePredict).

## Models

A model in Fiddler represents a **placeholder** for a machine-learning model. It''s a placeholder because we may not need the **[model artifacts](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#Model-Artifacts)**. Instead, we may just need adequate [information about the model](ref:fdlmodelinfo) in order to monitor model-specific data. 

> 📘 Info
> 
> You can [upload your model artifacts](https://dash.readme.com/project/fiddler/v1.6/docs/uploading-model-artifacts) to Fiddler to unlock high-fidelity explainability for your model. However, it is not required. If you do not wish to upload your artifact but want to explore explainability with Fiddler, we can build a [**surrogate model**](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#surrogate-model) on the backend to be used in place of your artifact.

## Datasets

A dataset in Fiddler is a data table containing [information about data](ref:fdldatasetinfo) such as **features**, **model outputs**, and a **target** for machine learning models. Optionally, you can also upload **metadata** and “**decision**” columns, which can be used to segment the dataset for analyses, track business decisions, and work as protected attributes in bias-related workflows. 

In order to monitor **production data**, a [dataset must be uploaded](ref:clientupload_dataset) to be used as a **baseline** for making comparisons. This baseline dataset should be sampled from your model''s **training data**. The sample should be unbiased and should faithfully capture moments of the parent distribution. Further, values appearing in the baseline dataset''s columns should be representative of their entire ranges within the complete training dataset.

**Datasets are used by Fiddler in the following ways:**

1. As a reference for [drift calculations](doc:data-drift-platform) and [data integrity violations ](doc:data-integrity-platform)on the **[Monitor](doc:monitoring-ui)** page
2. To train a model to be used as a [surrogate](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#surrogate-model) when using [`add_model_surrogate`](/reference/clientadd_model_surrogate)
3. For computing model performance metrics globally on the **[Evaluate](doc:evaluation-ui)** page, or on slices on the **[Analyze](doc:analytics-ui)** page
4. As a reference for explainability algorithms (e.g. partial dependence plots, permutation feature impact, approximate Shapley values, and ICE plots).

Based on the above uses, _datasets with sizes much in excess of 10K rows are often unnecessary_ and can lead to excessive upload, precomputation, and query times. That being said, here are some situations where larger datasets may be desirable:

Event publication is the process of sending your model''s prediction logs, or events, to the Fiddler platform.  Using the [Fiddler Client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), events can be published in batch or streaming mode.  Using these events, Fiddler will calculate metrics around feature drift, prediction drift, and model performance.  These events are also stored in Fiddler to allow for ad hoc segment analysis.

Fiddler allows you to publish a single file containing events for multiple models using one API call.

To do this, you can include conditional keys in the schema, which can be used to tell Fiddler which project/model to publish to.

Here''s an example of what these conditionals looks like within a schema:

```python
publish_schema = {
    ""__static"": {
        ""__default_timestamp"": ""CURRENT_TIME""
    },
    ""__dynamic"": {
        ""__timestamp"": ""column0"",
        ""__project"": ""column1""
        ""__model"": ""column2"",

        ""!example_project_1,example_model_1"": {
            ""feature0"": ""column3"",
            ""feature1"": ""column4"",
            ""model_output"": ""column6"",
            ""model_target"": ""column7""
        },

        ""!example_project_1,example_model_2"": {
            ""feature0"": ""column4"",
            ""feature1"": ""column5"",
            ""model_output"": ""column6"",
            ""model_target"": ""column7""
        },

        ""!example_project_2,example_model_3"": {
            ""feature0"": ""column3"",
            ""feature1"": ""column5"",
            ""model_output"": ""column6"",
            ""model_target"": ""column7""
        }
    }
}
```

In the above schema, we use the `""!example_project_1,example_model_1""` conditional to tell Fiddler to publish the events to the  Document:  slug: ""publishing-events-with-complex-data-formats"" ,
                ""even_more_data"": [
                    {
                        ""value4"": 4,
                        ""value5"": 5
                    },
                    {
                        ""value4"": 6,
                        ""value5"": 7
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                ""value2"": 8,
                ""value3"": 9,
                ""even_more_data"": [
                    {
                        ""value4"": 10,
                        ""value5"": 11
                    },
                    {
                        ""value4"": 12,
                        ""value5"": 13
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Notice that we have four records contained within identical subtrees of the structure. Fiddler will perform a join on the values within the subtrees and the values outside of the subtrees.

```python
publish_schema = {
    ""__static"": {
        ""__project"": ""example_project"",
        ""__model"": ""example_model"",
        ""__default_timestamp"": ""CURRENT_TIME""
    },
    ""__dynamic"": {
        ""value0"": ""data/value0"",
        ""value1"": ""data/value1""
    },
    ""__iterator"": {
        ""__iterator_key"": ""more_data"",
        ""__dynamic"": {
            ""value2"": ""value2"",
            ""value3"": ""value3""
        },
        ""__iterator"": {
            ""__iterator_key"": ""even_more_data"",
            ""__dynamic"": {
                ""value4"": ""value4"",
                ""value5"": ""value5""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method allows you to publish a batch of events to Fiddler asynchronously. 

Here are the steps to upload multiple events:

1. Create a pandas DataFrame containing the batch of events you want to upload.
2. Use the `client.publish_events_batch` method and provide the following parameters:
   - `project_id`: The unique identifier for the project.
   - `model_id`: A unique identifier for the model.
   - `batch_source`: Either a pandas DataFrame containing the batch of events or the path to a file containing the batch of events.
   - `id_field` (optional): The field containing event IDs for events in the batch. If not specified, Fiddler will generate its own ID.
   - `update_event` (optional): If set to True, will only modify an existing event referenced by the ID field. If an ID is provided for which there is no event, no change will take place.
   - `timestamp_field` (optional): The field containing timestamps for events in the batch. If not specified, the current time will be used.
   - `timestamp_format` (optional): The format of the timestamp passed in the timestamp field. It can be one of the following: `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.INFER`, `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.EPOCH_MILLISECONDS`, `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.EPOCH_SECONDS`, `fdl.FiddlerTimestamp.ISO_8601`.
   - `data_source` (optional): The location of the data source provided. By default, Fiddler will try to infer the value.

For more details and examples, you can refer to the [client.publish_events_batch](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/clientpublish_events_batch) documentation.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Here you can see a list of the models contained within the Lending project, as well as a project dashboard to which analyze charts can be pinned. Go ahead and click the “logreg-all” model.

![](https://files.readme.io/f3e024d-image.png)

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform''s core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Analyze_** — Analyze the behavior of your model in aggregate or with respect to specific segments of your population. Read the [Analytics](doc:analytics-ui) documentation for more details.
- **_Explain_** — Generate “point” or prediction-level explanations on your training or production data for insight into how each model decision was made. Read the [Explainability](doc:explainability-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Evaluate_** — View your model’s performance on its training and test sets for quick validation prior to deployment. Read the [Evaluation](doc:evaluation-ui) documentation for more details.

Fiddler supports a wide range of strategies for routing HTTP traffic from end users to the Fiddler system. A typical on-prem Fiddler deployment includes an HTTP reverse proxy (Envoy) that can be configured as needed to meet your routing needs.

![](https://files.readme.io/fd4b216-image.png)

The diagram above shows some of the deployment configuration options related to routing and TLS, described below. Once Fiddler is installed in your on-prem environment, you may need to take  additional steps to route TCP traffic to the Fiddler Envoy service.

# TLS termination

By default, Fiddler does not perform TLS termination. We find that our customers generally have excellent opinions about how TLS should be terminated, and generally prefer to perform TLS termination using their own network machinery.

## Terminate TLS outside of Fiddler

In a typical production environment, TLS termination will occur outside of Fiddler. Clear HTTP traffic should then be routed to the Fiddler Envoy service at the port specified by `envoy.publicHttpPort`. 

```
envoy:
  terminateTLS: false
  publicHttpPort: ""80""
```

## Terminate TLS within Fiddler

Fiddler can be configured to perform TLS termination using an X509 server certificate and corresponding PKCS #8 private key. The TLS certificate must be valid for the FQDN via which end-users will access the Fiddler platform. Both the server certificate and private key must be available in DER format, and should be placed in a `Secret` within the namespace where Fiddler will be deployed prior to installation. For example:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret \
    --cert=path/to/the/cert.pem \
    --key=path/to/the/cert.key
```

The Fiddler Helm chart should be configured to reflect the `Secret` containing the server cert and key. TCP traffic should be routed to the port specified by `envoy.publicHttpsPort`.

```yaml
envoy:
  terminateTLS: true
  tlsSecretName: my-tls-secret
  serverCertKey: tls.crt
  privateKeyKey: tls.key
  publicHttpsPort: ""443""
```

## TLS with Ingress

Kubernetes `Ingress` [supports](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls) specifying a TLS secret on a per-ingress basis. If using an `Ingress` to route traffic to Fiddler, create a `Secret` containing the DER-formatted X509 server certificate and PKCS #8 private key in the namespace where Fiddler will be deployed:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret \
    --cert=path/to/the/cert.pem \
    --key=path/to/the/cert.key
```

The Fiddler Helm chart should be configured to enable Ingress with TLS. For example:

```
envoy:
  createIngress: true

ingress:
  tls:
    hosts:
      # The FQDN where Fiddler is accessed by end users.
      - fiddler.acme.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret
```

## Creating Dashboards

To begin using our dashboard feature, navigate to the dashboard page by clicking on ""Dashboards"" from the top-level navigation bar. On the Dashboards page, you can choose to either select from previously created dashboards or create a new one. This simple process allows you to quickly access your dashboards and begin monitoring your models'' performance, data drift, data integrity, and traffic.

![](https://files.readme.io/570614f-image.png)

When creating a new dashboard, it''s important to note that each dashboard is tied to a specific project space. This means that only models and charts associated with that project can be added to the dashboard. To ensure you''re working within the correct project space, select the desired project space before entering the dashboard editor page, then click ""Continue."" This will ensure that you can add relevant charts and models to your dashboard.

## Add Monitoring Chart

Once you’ve created a dashboard, you can add previously saved monitoring charts that display these metrics over time, making it easy to track changes and identify patterns.

![](https://files.readme.io/b862277-image.png)

To create a new monitoring chart for your dashboard, simply select ""New Monitoring Chart"" from the ""Add"" dropdown menu. For more information on creating and customizing monitoring charts, check out our Monitoring Charts UI Guide.

If you''d like to add an existing chart to your dashboard, select ""Saved Charts"" to display a full list of monitoring charts that are available in your project space. This makes it easy to quickly access and add the charts you need to your dashboard for monitoring and reporting purposes.

![](https://files.readme.io/2c3857c-image.png)

To further customize your dashboard, you can select the saved monitoring charts of interest by clicking on their respective cards. For instance, you might choose to add charts for Accuracy, Drift, Traffic, and Range Violation to your dashboard for a more comprehensive model overview. By adding these charts to your dashboard, you can quickly access important metrics and visualize your model''s performance over time, enabling you to identify trends and patterns that might require further investigation.

## Dashboard Filters

There are three main filters that can be applied to all the charts within dashboards, these include date range, time zone, and bin size. 

![](https://files.readme.io/0795752-image.png)

### Date Range

When the `Default` time range is selected, the data range, time zone, and bin size that each monitoring chart was originally saved with will be applied. This enables you to create a dashboard where each chart shows a unique filter set to highlight what matters to each team. Updating the date range will unlock the time zone and bin size filters. You can select from a number of predefined ranges or choose `Custom` to select a start and end date-time.

![](https://files.readme.io/960262c-image.png)

### Bin Size

Bin size controls the frequency at which data is displayed on your monitoring charts. You can select from the following bin sizes: `Hour`, `Day`, `  Document:  ---

## Model Comparison

With our dashboard feature, you can also compare multiple models side-by-side, making it easy to see which models are performing the best and which may require additional attention. To create model-to-model comparison dashboards, ensure the models you wish to compare belong to the same project. Create the desired charts for each model and then add them to a single dashboard. By creating a single dashboard that tracks the health of all of your models, you can save time and simplify your AI monitoring efforts. With these dashboards, you can easily share insights with your team, management, or stakeholders, and ensure that everyone is up-to-date on your AI performance.

### Check [Dashboard Utilities ](doc:dashboard-utilities)and [Dashboard Interactions](doc:dashboard-interactions) pages for more info on dashboard usage.","Dashboards and PSI (Project Structure Interface) serve different purposes. 

Dashboards in Fiddler are used to create comprehensive views of your monitoring data, including charts for data drift, traffic, data integrity, and performance metrics. You can add monitoring charts to your dashboards to track your model''s performance and make data-driven decisions. Dashboards allow you to analyze the overall health and performance of your models and compare multiple models. You can customize your dashboard view using filters such as date range, time zone, and bin size. You can also save, delete, or share your dashboard, edit base charts, and perform model-to-model comparisons.

On the other hand, PSI is used to collate specific visualizations under the Project Dashboard. It allows you to pin visualizations created using the Model Analytics tool to the dashboard and share them with others. PSI is part of the project structure and helps organize and present visualizations in a centralized manner.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

It allows Data Science, MLOps, and LOB teams to gain insights into their models and build trust in AI.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

- **_Decisions_** - The post-prediction business decisions made as a result of the model output. Decisions are calculated before [client.publish_event()](ref:clientpublish_event) (they''re not inferred by Fiddler). For binary classification models, a decision is usually determined using a threshold. For multi-class classification models, it''s usually determined using the argmax value of the model outputs.

- **_Performance metrics_**
  1. For binary classification models:
     - Accuracy
     - True Positive Rate/Recall
     - False Positive Rate
     - Precision
     - F1 Score
     - AUC
     - AUROC
     - Binary Cross Entropy
     - Geometric Mean
     - Calibrated Threshold
     - Data Count
     - Expected Calibration Error
  2. For multi-class classification models:
     - Accuracy
     - Log loss
  3. For regression models:
     - Coefficient of determination (R-squared)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
     - Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE)
  4. For ranking models:

Fiddler AI’s monitoring charts allow you to easily track your models and ensure that they are performing optimally. For any of your models, monitoring charts for data drift, performance, data integrity, or traffic metrics can be displayed using Fiddler Dashboards.

## Supported Metric Types

Monitoring charts enable you to plot one of the following metric types for a given model:

- [**Data Drift**](doc:data-drift-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Plot drift for up to 20 columns at once and track it using your choice of Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD) or Population Stability Index (PSI).
- [**Performance**](doc:performance-tracking-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Available metrics are model dependent.
- [**Data Integrity Violations**](doc:data-integrity-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Plot data integrity violations for up to 20 columns and track one of the three violations at once.
- [**Traffic **](doc:traffic-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

## Key Features:

### Multiple Charting Options

You can [plot up to 20 columns](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#chart-metric-queries--filters) and 6 metric queries for a model enabling you to easily perform model-to-model comparisons and plot multiple metrics in a single chart view.

### Downloadable CSV Data

You can [easily download a CSV of the raw chart data](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#breakdown-summary). This feature allows you to analyze your data further.

### Advanced Chart Functionality

The monitoring charts feature offers [advanced chart functionalities ](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#chart-metric-queries--filters)  to provide you with the flexibility to customize your charts and view your data in a way that is most useful to you. Features include:

- Zoom
- Dragging of time ranges
- Toggling between bar and line chart types
- Adjusting the scale between linear and log options
- Adjusting the range of the y-axis

Fiddler AI’s monitoring charts allow you to easily track your models and ensure that they are performing optimally. For any of your models, monitoring charts for data drift, performance, data integrity, or traffic metrics can be displayed using Fiddler Dashboards.

## Supported Metric Types

Monitoring charts enable you to plot one of the following metric types for a given model:

- [**Data Drift**](doc:data-drift-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Plot drift for up to 20 columns at once and track it using your choice of Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD) or Population Stability Index (PSI).
- [**Performance**](doc:performance-tracking-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Available metrics are model dependent.
- [**Data Integrity Violations**](doc:data-integrity-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Plot data integrity violations for up to 20 columns and track one of the three violations at once.
- [**Traffic **](doc:traffic-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

## Key Features:

### Multiple Charting Options

You can [plot up to 20 columns](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#chart-metric-queries--filters) and 6 metric queries for a model enabling you to easily perform model-to-model comparisons and plot multiple metrics in a single chart view.

### Downloadable CSV Data

You can [easily download a CSV of the raw chart data](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#breakdown-summary). This feature allows you to analyze your data further.

### Advanced Chart Functionality

The monitoring charts feature offers [advanced chart functionalities ](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#chart-metric-queries--filters)  to provide you with the flexibility to customize your charts and view your data in a way that is most useful to you. Features include:

- Zoom
- Dragging of time ranges
- Toggling between bar and line chart types
- Adjusting the scale between linear and log options
- Adjusting the range of the y-axis

3. Monitoring data integrity issues that could harm the model performance
4. Investigating the features which have drifted/ compromised and analyzing them to mitigate the issue
5. Performing a root cause analysis to identify the exact cause and fix it
6. Diving into point explanations to identify how much the issue has an impact on a particular data point
7. Setting up alerts to make sure the issue does not happen again

We discovered there was an issue with the ‘Category’ column, wherein a new value was discovered in the production data. This led to the performance drop in the data likely due to the range violation. We suggest two steps to mitigate this issue:

1. Setting up ‘alerts’ to identify similar issues in data integrity
2. Retraining the ML model after including the new data (with the ground truth labels) to teach the model of the new values

[/block]","You can track various performance metrics for your models, depending on the type of model you have. For binary classification models, you can track metrics such as accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate, precision, F1 score, AUC, AUROC, binary cross entropy, geometric mean, calibrated threshold, data count, expected calibration error, and more. For multi-class classification models, you can track metrics such as accuracy and log loss. For regression models, you can track metrics such as coefficient of determination (R-squared), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE). For ranking models, you can track metrics such as mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).

Fiddler currently supports four model tasks. These include:

- Binary Classification
- Multi-class Classification
- Regression
- Ranking

**Binary classification** is the task of classifying the elements of an outcome set into two groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical binary classification problems include:

- Determining whether a customer will churn or not. Here the outcome set has two outcomes: The customer will churn or the customer will not. Further, the outcome can only belong to either of the two classes.
- Determining whether a patient has a disease or not. Here the outcome set has two outcomes: the patient has the disease or does not.

**Multiclass classification** is the task of classifying the elements of an outcome set into three or more groups (each called class) on the basis of a classification rule. Typical multiclass classification problems include:

- Determining whether an image is a cat, a dog, or a bird. Here the outcome set has more than two outcomes. Further, the image can only be determined to be one of the three outcomes and it''s thus a multiclass classification problem.

**Regression** is the task of predicting a continuous numeric quantity. Typical regression problems include:

- Determining the average home price based on a given set of housing related features such as it''s square footage, number of beds and bath, it''s location etc.
- Determining the income of an individual based on features such as their age, work location, their job sector etc.

**Ranking** is the task of constructing a rank ordered list of items given a particular query that seeks some information. Typical ranking problems include:

- Ranking documents in information retrieval systems.
- Ranking relevancy of advertisements based on user search queries.  Document:  ---

A model is a **representation of your machine learning model**. Each model must have an associated dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring, explainability, and fairness capabilities.

You **do not need to upload your model artifact in order to onboard your model**, but doing so will significantly improve the quality of explanations generated by Fiddler.  Document:  ---

It''s common to want to modify your [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object in the case where **something was inferred incorrectly** by [`fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo-from_dataframe).

Let''s walk through an example of how to do this.

***

Suppose you''ve loaded in a dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(''example_dataset.csv'')
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/3ffd956-example_df_1.png ""example_df (1).png"")

***

Suppose you create a [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object by inferring the details from this DataFrame.

```python
dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df)
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/571f9e4-example_datasetinfo.png ""example_datasetinfo.png"")

But upon inspection, you notice **a few things are wrong**.

1. The [value range](#modifying-a-columns-value-range) of `output_column` is set to `[0.01, 0.99]`, when it should really be `[0.0, 1.0]`.
2. There are no [possible values](#modifying-a-columns-possible-values) set for `feature_3`.
3. The [data type](#modifying-a-columns-data-type) of `feature_3` is set to [`fdl.DataType.STRING`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype), when it should really be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

Let''s see how we can address these issues.

## Modifying a column’s value range

Let''s say we want to modify the range of `output_column` in the above [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object to be `[0.0, 1.0]`.

You can do this by setting the `value_range_min` and `value_range_max` of the `output_column` column.

```python
dataset_info[''output_column''].value_range_min = 0.0
dataset_info[''output_column''].value_range_max = 1.0
```

## Modifying a column’s possible values

Let''s say we want to modify the possible values of `feature_3` to be `[''Yes'', ''No'']`.

You can do this by setting the `possible_values` of the `feature_3` column.

```python
dataset_info[''feature_3''].possible_values = [''Yes'', ''No'']
```

## Modifying a column’s data type

Let''s say we want to modify the data type of `feature_3` to be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

You can do this by setting the `data_type` of the `feature_3` column.

```python
dataset_info[''feature_3''].data_type = fdl.DataType.CATEGORY
```

Let''s say we want to modify the range of `output_column` in the above [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object to be `[0.0, 1.0]`.

You can do this by setting the `value_range_min` and `value_range_max` of the `output_column` column.

```python
dataset_info[''output_column''].value_range_min = 0.0
dataset_info[''output_column''].value_range_max = 1.0
```

## Modifying a column’s possible values

Let''s say we want to modify the possible values of `feature_3` to be `[''Yes'', ''No'']`.

You can do this by setting the `possible_values` of the `feature_3` column.

```python
dataset_info[''feature_3''].possible_values = [''Yes'', ''No'']
```

## Modifying a column’s data type

Let''s say we want to modify the data type of `feature_3` to be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

You can do this by setting the `data_type` of the `feature_3` column.

```python
dataset_info[''feature_3''].data_type = fdl.DataType.CATEGORY
```

It''s common to want to modify your [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object in the case where **something was inferred incorrectly** by [`fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo-from_dataframe).

Let''s walk through an example of how to do this.

***

Suppose you''ve loaded in a dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(''example_dataset.csv'')
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/3ffd956-example_df_1.png ""example_df (1).png"")

***

Suppose you create a [`fdl.DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) object by inferring the details from this DataFrame.

```python
dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df)
```

Below is an example of what is displayed upon inspection.

![](https://files.readme.io/571f9e4-example_datasetinfo.png ""example_datasetinfo.png"")

But upon inspection, you notice **a few things are wrong**.

1. The [value range](#modifying-a-columns-value-range) of `output_column` is set to `[0.01, 0.99]`, when it should really be `[0.0, 1.0]`.
2. There are no [possible values](#modifying-a-columns-possible-values) set for `feature_3`.
3. The [data type](#modifying-a-columns-data-type) of `feature_3` is set to [`fdl.DataType.STRING`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype), when it should really be [`fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datatype).

Let''s see how we can address these issues.

In order for Fiddler to monitor drift or data integrity issues in incoming production data, it needs something to compare this data to.

A baseline dataset is a **representative sample** of the kind of data you expect to see in production. It represents the ideal form of data that your model works best on.

*For this reason,* ***it should be sampled from your model’s training set.***

***

**A few things to keep in mind when designing a baseline dataset:**

* It’s important to include **enough data** to ensure you have a representative sample of the training set.
* You may want to consider **including extreme values (min/max)** of each column in your training set so you can properly monitor range violations in production data. However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).  Document:  ---

However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).","To customize your dataset schema, you can modify the `fdl.DatasetInfo` object. Here are the steps to customize the schema:

1. Load your dataset as a pandas DataFrame.
2. Create a `fdl.DatasetInfo` object by inferring the details from the DataFrame using `fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df)`.
3. Modify the schema as needed:
   - To modify a column''s value range, set the `value_range_min` and `value_range_max` of the column.
   - To modify a column''s possible values, set the `possible_values` of the column.
   - To modify a column''s data type, set the `data_type` of the column to `fdl.DataType.CATEGORY`.
4. Upload or publish the modified dataset.

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

![](https://files.readme.io/6442827-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.03_PM.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/f1dbcf6-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.15_PM.png)

You can also pass the above information to your Fiddler administrator via your okta.yml file. 

## Logging into Fiddler:

Once a Fiddler administrator has successfully set up a deployment for your organization using your given Okta credentials, you should see the “Sign in with SSO” button enabled. When this button is clicked, you should be navigated to an Okta login screen. Once successfully authenticated, and assuming you have been granted access to Fiddler through Okta, you should be able to login to Fiddler.

NOTES:

1. To be able to login with SSO, it is initially required for the user to register with Fiddler Application. Upon successful registration, the users will be able to login using SSO.
2. The only information Fiddler stores from Okta based logins is a user’s first name, last name, email address, and OIDC token.
3. Fiddler does not currently support using Okta based login through its API (see fiddler-client). In order to use an Okta based account through Fiddler''s API, use a valid access token which can be created and copied on the “Credentials” tab on Fiddler’s “Settings” page.  Document:  ---

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

![](https://files.readme.io/6442827-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.03_PM.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/f1dbcf6-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.15_PM.png)

You can also pass the above information to your Fiddler administrator via your okta.yml file. 

## Logging into Fiddler:

Once a Fiddler administrator has successfully set up a deployment for your organization using your given Okta credentials, you should see the “Sign in with SSO” button enabled. When this button is clicked, you should be navigated to an Okta login screen. Once successfully authenticated, and assuming you have been granted access to Fiddler through Okta, you should be able to login to Fiddler.

### Saved Model Updates

If you recently created or updated a saved chart and are not seeing the changes either on the dashboard itself or the Saved Charts list, click the refresh button on the main dashboard studio or within the saved charts list to reflect updates.

## Model Comparison

With our dashboard feature, you can also compare multiple models side-by-side, making it easy to see which models are performing the best and which may require additional attention. To create model-to-model comparison dashboards, ensure the models you wish to compare belong to the same project. Create the desired charts for each model and then add them to a single dashboard. By creating a single dashboard that tracks the health of all of your models, you can save time and simplify your AI monitoring efforts. With these dashboards, you can easily share insights with your team, management, or stakeholders, and ensure that everyone is up-to-date on your AI performance.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

Model performance can be poor if models trained on a specific dataset encounter different data in production. This is called data drift. In the **Monitor** tab for your model, Fiddler gives you a visual way to explore data drift and identify what data is drifting, when it’s drifting, and how it’s drifting. This is the first step in identifying possible model performance issues.

![](https://files.readme.io/0d04342-Monitoring-DataDrift.png ""Monitoring-DataDrift.png"")

You can change the time range using the controls in the upper-right:

![](https://files.readme.io/d5809f8-Monitoring-TimeRange.png ""Monitoring-TimeRange.png"")

## What is being tracked?

- **_Drift Metrics_**
  - **Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD)**
    - A distance metric calculated between the distribution of a field in the baseline dataset and that same distribution for the time period of interest.
    - For more information on JSD, click [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon.html).
  - **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
    - A drift metric based on the multinomial classification of a variable into bins or categories. The differences in each bin between the baseline and the time period of interest are then utilized to calculate it as follows:

![](https://files.readme.io/0baeb90-psi_calculation.png ""psi_calculation.png"")

Here, `B` is the total number of bins, `ActualProp(b)` is the proportion of counts within bin `b` from the target distribution, and `ExpectedProp(b)` is the proportion of counts within bin `b` from the reference distribution. Thus, PSI is a number that ranges from zero to infinity and has a value of zero when the two distributions exactly match.

> 🚧 Note
> 
> Since there is a possibility that a particular bin may be empty, PSI can shoot to infinity. To avoid this, PSI calculation in Fiddler is done such that each bin count is incremented with a base_count=1. Thus, there might be a slight difference in the PSI values obtained from manual calculations.

- **_Average Values_** – The mean of a field (feature or prediction) over time. This can be thought of as an intuitive drift score.
- **_Drift Analytics_** – You can drill down into the features responsible for the prediction drift using the table at the bottom.
  - **_Feature Impact_**: The contribution of a feature to the model’s predictions, averaged over the baseline dataset. The contribution is calculated using random ablation feature impact.
  - **_Feature Drift_**: Drift of the feature, calculated using the drift metric of choice.
  - **_Prediction Drift Impact_**: A heuristic calculated using the product of the feature impact and the feature drift. The higher the score, the more this feature is likely to have contributed to the prediction drift.

In the Drift Analytics table, you can select a feature to see the feature distribution for both the time period under consideration and the baseline dataset. If it’s a numerical feature, you will also see a time series of the average feature value over time.

### Saved Model Updates

If you recently created or updated a saved chart and are not seeing the changes either on the dashboard itself or the Saved Charts list, click the refresh button on the main dashboard studio or within the saved charts list to reflect updates.

![](https://files.readme.io/706c198-image.png)

## Model Comparison

With our dashboard feature, you can also compare multiple models side-by-side, making it easy to see which models are performing the best and which may require additional attention. To create model-to-model comparison dashboards, ensure the models you wish to compare belong to the same project. Create the desired charts for each model and then add them to a single dashboard. By creating a single dashboard that tracks the health of all of your models, you can save time and simplify your AI monitoring efforts. With these dashboards, you can easily share insights with your team, management, or stakeholders, and ensure that everyone is up-to-date on your AI performance.

## Dashboard

Once visualizations are created, you can pin them to the project dashboard, which can be shared with others.

To pin a chart, click on the thumbtack icon and click **Send**. If the **Update with Query** option is enabled, the pinned chart will update automatically whenever the underlying query is changed on the **Analyze** tab.

# Vector Monitoring for Unstructured Data

While Fiddler calculates data drift at deployment time for numerical features that are stored in columns of the baseline dataset, many modern machine learning systems use input features that cannot be represented as a single number (e.g., text or image data). Such complex features are usually rather represented by high-dimensional vectors which are obtained by applying a vectorization method (e.g., text embeddings generated by NLP models). Furthermore, Fiddler users might be interested in monitoring a group of univariate features together and detecting data drift in multi-dimensional feature spaces.

In order to address the above needs, Fiddler provides vector monitoring capability which involves enabling users to define custom features, and a novel method for monitoring data drift in multi-dimensional spaces.

### Defining Custom Features

Users can use the Fiddler client to define one or more custom features. Each custom feature is specified by a group of dataset columns that need to be monitored together as a vector. Once a list of custom features is defined and passed to Fiddler (the details of how to use the Fiddler client to define custom features are provided in the following.), Fiddler runs a clustering-based data drift detection algorithm for each custom feature and calculates a corresponding drift value between the baseline and the published events at the selected time period.

```python pyth
CF1 = fdl.CustomFeature.from_columns([''f1'',''f2'',''f3''], custom_name = ''vector1'')
CF2 = fdl.CustomFeature.from_columns([''f1'',''f2'',''f3''], n_clusters=5, custom_name = ''vector2'')
```

### Passing Custom Features List to Model Info

```python
model_info = fdl.ModelInfo.from_dataset_info(
    dataset_info=dataset_info,
    dataset_id = DATASET_ID,
    features = data_cols,
    target=''target'',
    outputs=''predicted_score'',
    custom_features = [CF1,CF2]
)

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

Fiddler AI’s monitoring charts allow you to easily track your models and ensure that they are performing optimally. For any of your models, monitoring charts for data drift, performance, data integrity, or traffic metrics can be displayed using Fiddler Dashboards.

## Supported Metric Types

Monitoring charts enable you to plot one of the following metric types for a given model:

- [**Data Drift**](doc:data-drift-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Plot drift for up to 20 columns at once and track it using your choice of Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD) or Population Stability Index (PSI).
- [**Performance**](doc:performance-tracking-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Available metrics are model dependent.
- [**Data Integrity Violations**](doc:data-integrity-platform#what-is-being-tracked)
  - Plot data integrity violations for up to 20 columns and track one of the three violations at once.
- [**Traffic **](doc:traffic-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

## Key Features:

### Multiple Charting Options

You can [plot up to 20 columns](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#chart-metric-queries--filters) and 6 metric queries for a model enabling you to easily perform model-to-model comparisons and plot multiple metrics in a single chart view.

### Downloadable CSV Data

You can [easily download a CSV of the raw chart data](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#breakdown-summary). This feature allows you to analyze your data further.

### Advanced Chart Functionality

The monitoring charts feature offers [advanced chart functionalities ](doc:monitoring-charts-ui#chart-metric-queries--filters)  to provide you with the flexibility to customize your charts and view your data in a way that is most useful to you. Features include:

- Zoom
- Dragging of time ranges
- Toggling between bar and line chart types
- Adjusting the scale between linear and log options
- Adjusting the range of the y-axis

Check out more on the [Monitoring Charts UI Guide](doc:monitoring-charts-ui).","Vector monitoring is a capability provided by Fiddler that allows users to define custom features and monitor data drift in multi-dimensional feature spaces. It is particularly useful for monitoring complex features that cannot be represented as a single number, such as text or image data. Users can define custom features by specifying a group of dataset columns that need to be monitored together as a vector. Fiddler then runs a clustering-based data drift detection algorithm for each custom feature and calculates a drift value between the baseline and the published events.

In this notebook we present the steps for monitoring images. Fiddler employs a vector-based monitoring approach that can be used to monitor data drift in high-dimensional data such as NLP embeddings, images, video etc. In this notebook we demonstrate how to detect drift in image data using model embeddings.

Fiddler is the pioneer in enterprise Model Performance Management (MPM), offering a unified platform that enables Data Science, MLOps, Risk, Compliance, Analytics, and LOB teams to **monitor, explain, analyze, and improve ML deployments at enterprise scale**. 
Obtain contextual insights at any stage of the ML lifecycle, improve predictions, increase transparency and fairness, and optimize business revenue.

[/block]","To monitor a computer vision (CV) model using Fiddler, you can follow the steps outlined in the ""CV Monitoring"" documentation. Here is a summary of the steps:

1. Connect to Fiddler: You''ll need to provide the Fiddler URL, organization ID, and authorization token to connect to the Fiddler API.

2. Load and generate embeddings for CIFAR-10 dataset: This step involves loading the CIFAR-10 dataset and generating embeddings for the images using a pre-trained ResNet18 model.

3. Upload the vectorized baseline dataset: You''ll need to upload the vectorized baseline dataset, which contains the embeddings of the images.

4. Add metadata about your model: Provide information about your CV model, such as its name, version, and description.

5. Inject data drift and publish production events: Inject data drift into the system by modifying the baseline embeddings and publishing production events.

6. Get insights: Once the monitoring data is populated, you can analyze the drift and performance of your CV model using the Fiddler platform.

For more detailed instructions and code examples, you can refer to the [CV Monitoring documentation](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/cv-monitoring).

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

Suppose you would like to upload a model artifact for a **ranking model**.

Following is an example of what the `package.py` script may look like.

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class ModelPackage:

    def __init__(self):
        self.output_columns = [''score'']
        with open(PACKAGE_PATH / ''model.pkl'', ''rb'') as infile:
            self.model = pickle.load(infile)
    
    def predict(self, input_df):
        pred = self.model.predict(input_df)
        return pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=self.output_columns)
    
def get_model():
    return ModelPackage()
```

Here, we are assuming that the model prediction column that has been specified in the [`fdl.ModelInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-modelinfo) object is called `score`.

## Onboarding a Ranking Model

Suppose you would like to onboard a ranking model for the following dataset.

![](https://files.readme.io/1d6eb09-expedia_df.png ""expedia_df.png"")

Following is an example of how you would construct a [`fdl.ModelInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-modelinfo) object for a ranking model.

```python
PROJECT_ID = ''example_project''
DATASET_ID = ''expedia_data''
MODEL_ID = ''ranking_model''

model_task = fdl.ModelTask.RANKING
model_group_by = ''srch_id''
model_target = ''click_bool''
model_outputs = [''score'']
raning_top_k = 20
model_features = [
    ''price_usd'',
    ''promotion_flag'',
    ''weekday'',
    ''week_of_year'',
    ''hour_time'',
    ''minute_time''

model_info = fdl.ModelInfo.from_dataset_info(
    dataset_info=dataset_info,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    features=model_features,
    group_by=model_group_by,
    ranking_top_k=ranking_top_k,
    target=model_target,
    outputs=model_outputs,
    model_task=model_task,
)

client.add_model(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    model_info=model_info
)
```

> 📘 Note
> 
> Using [client.add_model()](ref:clientadd_model) does not provide Fiddler with a model artifact.  Onboarding a model in this fashion is a good start for model monitoring, but Fiddler will not be able to offer model explainability features without a model artifact.  You can subsequently call [client.add_model_surrogate()](ref:clientadd_model_surrogate) or [client.add_model_artifact()](ref:clientadd_model_artifact) to provide Fiddler with a model artifact.

Churn prediction is a common use case in the machine learning domain. Churn means “leaving the company”. It is very critical for a business to have an idea about why and when customers are likely to churn. Having a robust and accurate churn prediction model helps businesses to take action to prevent customers from leaving the company. Machine learning models have proved to be effective in detecting churn. However, if left unattended, the performance of churn models can degrade over time leading to losing customers. 

The Fiddler AI Observability platform provides a variety of tools that can be used to monitor, explain, analyze, and improve the performance of your machine learning-based churn model.

In this article we will go over a churn example and how we can mitigate performance degradation in a churn machine learning model.

Refer to the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-samples/blob/master/content_root/tutorial/business-use-cases/churn-usecase/Fiddler_Churn_Use_Case.ipynb) to learn how to -

1. Onboard model on the Fiddler platform
2. Publish events on the Fiddler platform
3. Use the Fiddler API to run explanations

### Example - Model Performance Degradation due to Data Integrity Issues

#### Step 1 - Setting up baseline and publishing production events

Please refer to our [Getting Started guide](https://docs.fiddler.ai/pages/getting-started/product-tour/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to upload baseline and production data to the Fiddler platform.

#### Step 2 - Monitor Drift

When we check the monitoring dashboard, we notice a drop in the predicted churn value and a rise in the predicted churn drift value. Our next step is to check if this has resulted in a drop in performance.

  ]
}
[/block]

#### Step 3 - Monitor Performance Metrics

We use **precision, recall, and F1-score** as accuracy metrics for this example. We’re choosing these metrics as they are suited for classification problems and help us in identifying the number of false positives and false negatives. We notice that although the precision has remained constant, there is a drop in the F1-score and recall, which means that there are a few customers who are likely to churn but the model is not able to predict their outcome correctly. 

There could be a number of reasons for drop in performance, some of them are-

1. Cases of extreme events (Outliers)
2. Data distribution changes
3. Model/Concept drift
4. Pipeline health issues

While **Pipeline health issues** could be due to a component in the Data pipeline failing, the first 3 could be due to changes in data. In order to check that we can go to the **Data Integrity** tab to first check if the incoming data is consistent with the baseline data.

Churn prediction is a common use case in the machine learning domain. Churn means “leaving the company”. It is very critical for a business to have an idea about why and when customers are likely to churn. Having a robust and accurate churn prediction model helps businesses to take action to prevent customers from leaving the company. Machine learning models have proved to be effective in detecting churn. However, if left unattended, the performance of churn models can degrade over time leading to losing customers. 

The Fiddler AI Observability platform provides a variety of tools that can be used to monitor, explain, analyze, and improve the performance of your machine learning-based churn model.

In this article we will go over a churn example and how we can mitigate performance degradation in a churn machine learning model.

Refer to the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-samples/blob/master/content_root/tutorial/business-use-cases/churn-usecase/Fiddler_Churn_Use_Case.ipynb) to learn how to -

1. Onboard model on the Fiddler platform
2. Publish events on the Fiddler platform
3. Use the Fiddler API to run explanations

### Example - Model Performance Degradation due to Data Integrity Issues

#### Step 1 - Setting up baseline and publishing production events

Please refer to our [Getting Started guide](https://docs.fiddler.ai/pages/getting-started/product-tour/) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to upload baseline and production data to the Fiddler platform.

#### Step 2 - Monitor Drift

When we check the monitoring dashboard, we notice a drop in the predicted churn value and a rise in the predicted churn drift value. Our next step is to check if this has resulted in a drop in performance.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]

#### Step 3 - Monitor Performance Metrics

We use **precision, recall, and F1-score** as accuracy metrics for this example. We’re choosing these metrics as they are suited for classification problems and help us in identifying the number of false positives and false negatives. We notice that although the precision has remained constant, there is a drop in the F1-score and recall, which means that there are a few customers who are likely to churn but the model is not able to predict their outcome correctly. 

There could be a number of reasons for drop in performance, some of them are-

1. Cases of extreme events (Outliers)
2. Data distribution changes
3. Model/Concept drift
4. Pipeline health issues

While **Pipeline health issues** could be due to a component in the Data pipeline failing, the first 3 could be due to changes in data. In order to check that we can go to the **Data Integrity** tab to first check if the incoming data is consistent with the baseline data.

## Monitoring class-imbalanced models

Drift is a measure of how different the production distribution is from the baseline distribution on which the model was trained. In practice, the distributions are approximated using histograms and then compared using divergence metrics like Jensen–Shannon divergence or Population Stability Index. Generally, when constructing the histograms, every event contributes equally to the bin counts.

However, for scenarios with large class imbalance the minority class’ contribution to the histograms would be minimal. Hence, any change in production distribution with respect to the minority class would not lead to a significant change in the production histograms. Consequently, even if there is a significant change in distribution with respect to the minority class, the drift value would not change significantly.

To solve this issue, Fiddler monitoring provides a way for events to be weighted based on the class distribution. For such models, when computing the histograms, events belonging to the minority class would be up-weighted whereas those belonging to the majority class would be down-weighted.

Fiddler has implemented two solutions for class imbalance use cases.

**Workflow 1: User provided global class weights**  
The user computes the class distribution on baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object.  
Class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset

- Please refer to the API docs on how to [specify global class-weights](/reference/fdlweightingparams)

- To tease out drift in a class-imbalanced fraud usecase checkout out the [class-imbalanced-fraud-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/blob/main/quickstart/Fiddler_Quickstart_Imbalanced_Data.ipynb)

**Workflow 2: User provided event level weights**  
User provides event level weights as a metadata column in baseline data and provides them while publishing events  
Details:

- Users will add an ""\_\_weight"" column in their model_info (must be a metadata type column, and must be nullable=True).

- The reference data needs to have an ""\_\_weight"" column, which may never be all null/missing/NaN  weights; all rows must contain valid float values. We expect the user to enforce this assumption.

- Note that the use of weighting parameters requires the presence of model outputs for both workflows in the baseline dataset.

Many ML use cases, like fraud detection and facial recognition, suffer from what is known as the _class imbalance problem_. This problem exists where a vast majority of the inferences seen by the model belong to only one class, known as the majority class. This makes detecting drift in the minority class very difficult as the ""signal"" is completely outweighed by the shear number of inferences seen in the majority class. 

This guide showcases how Fiddler uses a class weighting parameter to deal with this problem. This notebook will onboard two identical models -- one without class imbalance weighting and one with class imbalance weighting -- to illustrate how drift signals in the minority class are easier to detect once properly amplified by Fiddler''s unique class weighting approach..

**Questions?**  
  
Check out [our docs](https://docs.fiddler.ai/) for a more detailed explanation of what Fiddler has to offer.

If you''re still looking for answers, fill out a ticket on [our support page](https://fiddlerlabs.zendesk.com/) and we''ll get back to you shortly.","Fiddler provides two solutions for handling imbalanced datasets:

1. Workflow 1: User provided global class weights: In this workflow, the user computes the class distribution on the baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object. The class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset. To learn more about specifying global class weights, refer to the API docs on [specifying global class-weights](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/reference/fdlweightingparams).

2. Workflow 2: User provided event level weights: In this workflow, the user provides event level weights as a metadata column in the baseline data and provides them while publishing events. The model_info must include an ""__weight"" column, which must be a metadata type column and nullable=True. The reference data also needs to have an ""__weight"" column, which should contain valid float values and should not be all null/missing/NaN weights. To learn more about this workflow, refer to the documentation on [user provided event level weights](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/class-imbalanced-data#workflow-2-user-provided-event-level-weights).

## Monitoring class-imbalanced models

Drift is a measure of how different the production distribution is from the baseline distribution on which the model was trained. In practice, the distributions are approximated using histograms and then compared using divergence metrics like Jensen–Shannon divergence or Population Stability Index. Generally, when constructing the histograms, every event contributes equally to the bin counts.

However, for scenarios with large class imbalance the minority class’ contribution to the histograms would be minimal. Hence, any change in production distribution with respect to the minority class would not lead to a significant change in the production histograms. Consequently, even if there is a significant change in distribution with respect to the minority class, the drift value would not change significantly.

To solve this issue, Fiddler monitoring provides a way for events to be weighted based on the class distribution. For such models, when computing the histograms, events belonging to the minority class would be up-weighted whereas those belonging to the majority class would be down-weighted.

Fiddler has implemented two solutions for class imbalance use cases.

**Workflow 1: User provided global class weights**  
The user computes the class distribution on baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object.  
Class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset

- Please refer to the API docs on how to [specify global class-weights](/reference/fdlweightingparams)

- To tease out drift in a class-imbalanced fraud usecase checkout out the [class-imbalanced-fraud-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/blob/main/quickstart/Fiddler_Quickstart_Imbalanced_Data.ipynb)

**Workflow 2: User provided event level weights**  
User provides event level weights as a metadata column in baseline data and provides them while publishing events  
Details:

- Users will add an ""\_\_weight"" column in their model_info (must be a metadata type column, and must be nullable=True).

- The reference data needs to have an ""\_\_weight"" column, which may never be all null/missing/NaN  weights; all rows must contain valid float values. We expect the user to enforce this assumption.

- Note that the use of weighting parameters requires the presence of model outputs for both workflows in the baseline dataset.

Many ML use cases, like fraud detection and facial recognition, suffer from what is known as the _class imbalance problem_. This problem exists where a vast majority of the inferences seen by the model belong to only one class, known as the majority class. This makes detecting drift in the minority class very difficult as the ""signal"" is completely outweighed by the shear number of inferences seen in the majority class. 

This guide showcases how Fiddler uses a class weighting parameter to deal with this problem. This notebook will onboard two identical models -- one without class imbalance weighting and one with class imbalance weighting -- to illustrate how drift signals in the minority class are easier to detect once properly amplified by Fiddler''s unique class weighting approach..

1. Workflow 1: User provided global class weights: In this workflow, the user computes the class distribution on the baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object. The class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset. To learn more about specifying global class weights, refer to the API docs on [specifying global class-weights](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/reference/fdlweightingparams).

2. Workflow 2: User provided event level weights: In this workflow, the user provides event level weights as a metadata column in the baseline data and provides them while publishing events. The model_info must include an ""__weight"" column, which must be a metadata type column and nullable=True. The reference data also needs to have an ""__weight"" column, which should contain valid float values and should not be all null/missing/NaN weights. To learn more about this workflow, refer to the documentation on [user provided event level weights](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/class-imbalanced-data#workflow-2-user-provided-event-level-weights).

Many ML use cases, like fraud detection and facial recognition, suffer from what is known as the _class imbalance problem_. This problem exists where a vast majority of the inferences seen by the model belong to only one class, known as the majority class. This makes detecting drift in the minority class very difficult as the ""signal"" is completely outweighed by the shear number of inferences seen in the majority class. 

This guide showcases how Fiddler uses a class weighting parameter to deal with this problem. This notebook will onboard two identical models -- one without class imbalance weighting and one with class imbalance weighting -- to illustrate how drift signals in the minority class are easier to detect once properly amplified by Fiddler''s unique class weighting approach..

## Monitoring class-imbalanced models

Drift is a measure of how different the production distribution is from the baseline distribution on which the model was trained. In practice, the distributions are approximated using histograms and then compared using divergence metrics like Jensen–Shannon divergence or Population Stability Index. Generally, when constructing the histograms, every event contributes equally to the bin counts.

However, for scenarios with large class imbalance the minority class’ contribution to the histograms would be minimal. Hence, any change in production distribution with respect to the minority class would not lead to a significant change in the production histograms. Consequently, even if there is a significant change in distribution with respect to the minority class, the drift value would not change significantly.

To solve this issue, Fiddler monitoring provides a way for events to be weighted based on the class distribution. For such models, when computing the histograms, events belonging to the minority class would be up-weighted whereas those belonging to the majority class would be down-weighted.

Fiddler has implemented two solutions for class imbalance use cases.

**Workflow 1: User provided global class weights**  
The user computes the class distribution on baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object.  
Class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset

- Please refer to the API docs on how to [specify global class-weights](/reference/fdlweightingparams)

- To tease out drift in a class-imbalanced fraud usecase checkout out the [class-imbalanced-fraud-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/blob/main/quickstart/Fiddler_Quickstart_Imbalanced_Data.ipynb)

**Workflow 2: User provided event level weights**  
User provides event level weights as a metadata column in baseline data and provides them while publishing events  
Details:

- Users will add an ""\_\_weight"" column in their model_info (must be a metadata type column, and must be nullable=True).

- The reference data needs to have an ""\_\_weight"" column, which may never be all null/missing/NaN  weights; all rows must contain valid float values. We expect the user to enforce this assumption.

- Note that the use of weighting parameters requires the presence of model outputs for both workflows in the baseline dataset.

Consequently, even if there is a significant change in distribution with respect to the minority class, the drift value would not change significantly.

To solve this issue, Fiddler monitoring provides a way for events to be weighted based on the class distribution. For such models, when computing the histograms, events belonging to the minority class would be up-weighted whereas those belonging to the majority class would be down-weighted.

Fiddler has implemented two solutions for class imbalance use cases.

**Workflow 1: User provided global class weights**  
The user computes the class distribution on baseline data and then provides the class weights via the Model-Info object.  
Class weights can either be manually entered by the user or computed from their dataset

- Please refer to the API docs on how to [specify global class-weights](/reference/fdlweightingparams)

- To tease out drift in a class-imbalanced fraud usecase checkout out the [class-imbalanced-fraud-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/blob/main/quickstart/Fiddler_Quickstart_Imbalanced_Data.ipynb)

**Workflow 2: User provided event level weights**  
User provides event level weights as a metadata column in baseline data and provides them while publishing events  
Details:

- Users will add an ""\_\_weight"" column in their model_info (must be a metadata type column, and must be nullable=True).

- The reference data needs to have an ""\_\_weight"" column, which may never be all null/missing/NaN  weights; all rows must contain valid float values. We expect the user to enforce this assumption.

- Note that the use of weighting parameters requires the presence of model outputs for both workflows in the baseline dataset.

## Monitoring class-imbalanced models

Drift is a measure of how different the production distribution is from the baseline distribution on which the model was trained. In practice, the distributions are approximated using histograms and then compared using divergence metrics like Jensen–Shannon divergence or Population Stability Index. Generally, when constructing the histograms, every event contributes equally to the bin counts.

However, for scenarios with large class imbalance the minority class’ contribution to the histograms would be minimal. Hence, any change in production distribution with respect to the minority class would not lead to a significant change in the production histograms. Consequently, even if there is a significant change in distribution with respect to the minority class, the drift value would not change significantly.

1. Workflow 1: User provided global class weights: In this approach, the user computes the class distribution on the baseline data and provides the class weights via the Model-Info object. The class weights can be manually entered by the user or computed from the dataset. This allows Fiddler to amplify the signals from the minority class and make it easier to detect drift in the minority class.

2. Workflow 2: User provided event level weights: In this approach, the user provides event level weights as a metadata column in the baseline data and provides them while publishing events. The weights are added as an ""__weight"" column in the model_info and the reference data. Events belonging to the minority class are up-weighted, while those belonging to the majority class are down-weighted. This approach also helps in detecting drift in the minority class.

You can find more information about these approaches in the [Class-Imbalanced Data](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/class-imbalanced-data) documentation.

This page enumerates the new features and updates in Release 23.2 of the Fiddler platform.

## Release of Fiddler platform version 23.2:

- Support for uploading multiple baselines to a model

- Alert context overlay on the chart editor

- Ability to customize scale and range of y-axis on the chart editor

## What''s New and Improved:

- **Support for uploading multiple baselines**
  - Flexibility to add baseline datasets or use production data as the baseline.
  - Perform comparisons amongst multiple baselines to understand how different baselines — data shifts due seasonality or geography for example — may influence model drift and model behavior.
  - Learn more on the [Baselines Platform Guide](doc:fiddler-baselines).

- **Alert context overlay on the chart editor**
  - For absolute alerts, alert context is an overlay on the chart area to easily identify critical and warning thresholds.
  - For relative alerts, Fiddler will automatically plot historic comparison data for additional context on why the alert fired.

- **Customization in the chart editor**
  - Further customize charts by toggling between logarithmic and linear scale, and manually setting the min and max values of the y-axis.
  - Learn more on the [Monitoring Charts](doc:monitoring-charts-ui) page.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

## Model Artifacts and Model Package

A model in Fiddler is a placeholder that may not need the **model artifacts** for monitoring purposes. However, for explainability, model artifacts are needed. 

_Required_ model artifacts include: 

- The **[model file](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#model-file) **(e.g. `*.pkl`)
- [`package.py`](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#packagepy-wrapper-script): A wrapper script containing all of the code needed to standardize the execution of the model.

A collection of model artifacts in a directory is referred to as a **model package**. To start, **place your model artifacts in a new directory**. This directory will be the model package you will upload to Fiddler to add or update model artifacts. 

While the model file and package.py are required artifacts in a model package, you can also _optionally_ add other artifacts such as:

- [`model.yaml`](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#modelyaml-configuration-file): A YAML file containing all the information about the model as specified in [ModelInfo](ref:fdlmodelinfo). This model metadata is used in Fiddler’s explanations, analytics, and UI.
- Any serialized [preprocessing objects](#preprocessing-objects) needed to transform data before running predictions or after.

In the following, we discuss the various model artifacts.

### Model File

A model file is a **serialized representation of your model** as a Python object.

Model files can be stored in a variety of formats. Some include

- Pickle (`.pkl`)
- Protocol buffer (`.pb`)
- Hierarchical Data Format/HDF5 (`.h5`)

### package.py wrapper script

Fiddler’s artifact upload process is **framework-agnostic**. Because of this, a **wrapper script** is needed to let Fiddler know how to interact with your particular model and framework.

The wrapper script should be named `package.py`, and it should be **placed in the same directory as your model artifact**. Below is an example of what `package.py` should look like.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class MyModel:

    def __init__(self):
        """"""
        Here we can load in the model and any other necessary
            serialized objects from the PACKAGE_PATH.
        """"""

    def predict(self, input_df):
        """"""
        The predict() function should return a DataFrame of predictions
            whose columns correspond to the outputs of your model.
        """"""

def get_model():
    return MyModel()
```

The only hard requirements for `package.py` are

- The script must be named `package.py`
- The script must implement a function called `get_model`, which returns a model object
- This model object must implement a function called `predict`, which takes in a pandas DataFrame of model inputs and returns a pandas DataFrame of model predictions

### model.yaml configuration file

In case you want to update the custom explanations (`custom_explanation_names`) or the preferred explanation method (`preferred_explanation_method`) in the model info, you will need to construct a YAML file with **  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

## Model Artifacts and Model Package

A model in Fiddler is a placeholder that may not need the **model artifacts** for monitoring purposes. However, for explainability, model artifacts are needed. 

_Required_ model artifacts include: 

- The **[model file](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#model-file) **(e.g. `*.pkl`)
- [`package.py`](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#packagepy-wrapper-script): A wrapper script containing all of the code needed to standardize the execution of the model.

A collection of model artifacts in a directory is referred to as a **model package**. To start, **place your model artifacts in a new directory**. This directory will be the model package you will upload to Fiddler to add or update model artifacts. 

While the model file and package.py are required artifacts in a model package, you can also _optionally_ add other artifacts such as:

- [`model.yaml`](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates#modelyaml-configuration-file): A YAML file containing all the information about the model as specified in [ModelInfo](ref:fdlmodelinfo). This model metadata is used in Fiddler’s explanations, analytics, and UI.
- Any serialized [preprocessing objects](#preprocessing-objects) needed to transform data before running predictions or after.

In the following, we discuss the various model artifacts.

### Model File

A model file is a **serialized representation of your model** as a Python object.

Model files can be stored in a variety of formats. Some include

- Pickle (`.pkl`)
- Protocol buffer (`.pb`)
- Hierarchical Data Format/HDF5 (`.h5`)

### package.py wrapper script

Fiddler’s artifact upload process is **framework-agnostic**. Because of this, a **wrapper script** is needed to let Fiddler know how to interact with your particular model and framework.

The wrapper script should be named `package.py`, and it should be **placed in the same directory as your model artifact**. Below is an example of what `package.py` should look like.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class MyModel:

    def __init__(self):
        """"""
        Here we can load in the model and any other necessary
            serialized objects from the PACKAGE_PATH.
        """"""

    def predict(self, input_df):
        """"""
        The predict() function should return a DataFrame of predictions
            whose columns correspond to the outputs of your model.
        """"""

def get_model():
    return MyModel()
```

The only hard requirements for `package.py` are

- The script must be named `package.py`
- The script must implement a function called `get_model`, which returns a model object
- This model object must implement a function called `predict`, which takes in a pandas DataFrame of model inputs and returns a pandas DataFrame of model predictions

### model.yaml configuration file

In case you want to update the custom explanations (`custom_explanation_names`) or the preferred explanation method (`preferred_explanation_method`) in the model info, you will need to construct a YAML file with **  Document:  ---

Suppose you would like to upload a model artifact for a **ranking model**.

Following is an example of what the `package.py` script may look like.

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

        return pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=self.output_columns)

Please checkout this [quickstart notebook](doc:ranking-model) to work through an example of onboarding a ranking model on to Fiddler.","In the context of Fiddler, the term ""package.py"" refers to a wrapper script that contains all the code needed to standardize the execution of a model. It is a framework-agnostic script that is placed in the same directory as the model artifact. The ""package.py"" script should implement a function called ""get_model"" that returns a model object, and the model object should implement a function called ""predict"" that takes in a pandas DataFrame of model inputs and returns a pandas DataFrame of model predictions.

Fiddler provides a Python Client that allows you to connect to Fiddler directly from a Python notebook or automated pipeline.

Each client function is documented with a description, usage information, and code examples.","Sure! Here is an example of a `package.py` script in Fiddler:

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class ModelPackage:

    def __init__(self):
        self.output_columns = [''score'']
        with open(PACKAGE_PATH / ''model.pkl'', ''rb'') as infile:
            self.model = pickle.load(infile)
    
    def predict(self, input_df):
        pred = self.model.predict(input_df)
        return pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=self.output_columns)
    
def get_model():
    return ModelPackage()
```

This script demonstrates how to define a `ModelPackage` class that loads a trained model from a `model.pkl` file and provides a `predict` method to make predictions on input data. The predictions are returned as a pandas DataFrame with the specified output columns.

3f74714f-ddbe-4e13-b74f-858de9bb5f27,"  Document:  slug: ""data-drift"" e-Monitor_DriftAnaly.png ""Monitor_DriftAnaly.png"")

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

Model performance can be poor if models trained on a specific dataset encounter different data in production. This is called data drift. In the **Monitor** tab for your model, Fiddler gives you a visual way to explore data drift and identify what data is drifting, when it’s drifting, and how it’s drifting. This is the first step in identifying possible model performance issues.

![](https://files.readme.io/0d04342-Monitoring-DataDrift.png ""Monitoring-DataDrift.png"")

You can change the time range using the controls in the upper-right:

![](https://files.readme.io/d5809f8-Monitoring-TimeRange.png ""Monitoring-TimeRange.png"")

## What is being tracked?

- **_Drift Metrics_**
  - **Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD)**
    - A distance metric calculated between the distribution of a field in the baseline dataset and that same distribution for the time period of interest.
    - For more information on JSD, click [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon.html).
  - **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
    - A drift metric based on the multinomial classification of a variable into bins or categories. The differences in each bin between the baseline and the time period of interest are then utilized to calculate it as follows:

![](https://files.readme.io/0baeb90-psi_calculation.png ""psi_calculation.png"")

Here, `B` is the total number of bins, `ActualProp(b)` is the proportion of counts within bin `b` from the target distribution, and `ExpectedProp(b)` is the proportion of counts within bin `b` from the reference distribution. Thus, PSI is a number that ranges from zero to infinity and has a value of zero when the two distributions exactly match.

> 🚧 Note
> 
> Since there is a possibility that a particular bin may be empty, PSI can shoot to infinity. To avoid this, PSI calculation in Fiddler is done such that each bin count is incremented with a base_count=1. Thus, there might be a slight difference in the PSI values obtained from manual calculations.

- **_Average Values_** – The mean of a field (feature or prediction) over time. This can be thought of as an intuitive drift score.
- **_Drift Analytics_** – You can drill down into the features responsible for the prediction drift using the table at the bottom.
  - **_Feature Impact_**: The contribution of a feature to the model’s predictions, averaged over the baseline dataset. The contribution is calculated using random ablation feature impact.
  - **_Feature Drift_**: Drift of the feature, calculated using the drift metric of choice.
  - **_Prediction Drift Impact_**: A heuristic calculated using the product of the feature impact and the feature drift. The higher the score, the more this feature is likely to have contributed to the prediction drift.

In the Drift Analytics table, you can select a feature to see the feature distribution for both the time period under consideration and the baseline dataset. If it’s a numerical feature, you will also see a time series of the average feature value over time.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

Fiddler supports some simple statistic metrics which can be used to monitor basic aggregations over Columns.

These can be particularly useful when you have a custom metadata field which you would like to monitor over time in addition to Fiddler''s other out-of-the-box metrics.

Specifically, we support

- Average (takes the arithmetic mean of a numeric column)
- Sum (calculates the sum of a numeric column)

These metrics can be accessed in Charts and Alerts by selecting the Statistic Metric Type.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

## Onboarding a Ranking Model

Suppose you would like to onboard a ranking model for the following dataset.

![](https://files.readme.io/1d6eb09-expedia_df.png ""expedia_df.png"")

Following is an example of how you would construct a [`fdl.ModelInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-modelinfo) object for a ranking model.

```python
PROJECT_ID = ''example_project''
DATASET_ID = ''expedia_data''
MODEL_ID = ''ranking_model''

model_task = fdl.ModelTask.RANKING
model_group_by = ''srch_id''
model_target = ''click_bool''
model_outputs = [''score'']
raning_top_k = 20
model_features = [
    ''price_usd'',
    ''promotion_flag'',
    ''weekday'',
    ''week_of_year'',
    ''hour_time'',
    ''minute_time''

model_info = fdl.ModelInfo.from_dataset_info(
    dataset_info=dataset_info,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    features=model_features,
    group_by=model_group_by,
    ranking_top_k=ranking_top_k,
    target=model_target,
    outputs=model_outputs,
    model_task=model_task,
)

client.add_model(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    model_info=model_info
)
```

> 📘 Note
> 
> Using [client.add_model()](ref:clientadd_model) does not provide Fiddler with a model artifact.  Onboarding a model in this fashion is a good start for model monitoring, but Fiddler will not be able to offer model explainability features without a model artifact.  You can subsequently call [client.add_model_surrogate()](ref:clientadd_model_surrogate) or [client.add_model_artifact()](ref:clientadd_model_artifact) to provide Fiddler with a model artifact.  Please see [Uploading a Model Artifact](doc:uploading-model-artifacts) for more information.

> 🚧 Note
> 
> `group_by`: when onboarding a ranking model, you **must specify** a `group_by` argument to the [`fdl.ModelInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-modelinfo) object. It will tell Fiddler which column should be used for **grouping items** so that they may be ranked within a group.
> 
> `ranking_top_k`: an optional parameter unique to ranking model. Default to `50`. It''s an int representing the top k outputs to take into consideration when computing performance metrics MAP and NDCG.

> 📘 Tips
> 
> When onboarding a **graded ranking model** with **categorical target**, `categorical_target_class_detail` is a required argument for [`fdl.ModelInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-modelinfo) object. For example: `categorical_target_class_details=[''booked'',''click_no_booking'',''no_click'']`  Document:  ---

Suppose you would like to upload a model artifact for a **ranking model**.

Following is an example of what the `package.py` script may look like.

```python

        return pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=self.output_columns)

Here, we are assuming that the model prediction column that has been specified in the [`fdl.ModelInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-modelinfo) object is called `score`.

# 2. Upload the Baseline Dataset

Now we retrieve the Expedia Dataset as a baseline for this model.


```python
df = pd.read_csv(""https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/main/quickstart/data/expedia_baseline_data.csv"")
df.head()
```

Fiddler uses this baseline dataset to keep track of important information about your data.
  
This includes **data types**, **data ranges**, and **unique values** for categorical variables.

---

You can construct a `DatasetInfo` object to be used as **a schema for keeping track of this information** by running the following code block.


```python
dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(df=df, max_inferred_cardinality=100)
dataset_info
```

Then use the client''s [upload_dataset](https://docs.fiddler.ai/reference/clientupload_dataset) function to send this information to Fiddler!
  
*Just include:*
1. A unique dataset ID
2. The baseline dataset as a pandas DataFrame
3. The [DatasetInfo](https://docs.fiddler.ai/reference/fdldatasetinfo) object you just created


```python
DATASET_ID = ''expedia_data''
client.upload_dataset(project_id=PROJECT_ID,
                      dataset={''baseline'': df},
                      dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
                      info=dataset_info)
```

# 3. Share Model Metadata and Upload the Model


```python
#create model directory to sotre your model files
import os
model_dir = ""model""
os.makedirs(model_dir)
```

### 3.a Adding model metadata to Fiddler
To add a Ranking model you must specify the ModelTask as `RANKING` in the model info object.  

Additionally, you must provide the `group_by` argument that corresponds to the query search id. This `group_by` column should be present either in:
- `features` : if it is used to build and run the model
- `metadata_cols` : if not used by the model 

Optionally, you can give a `ranking_top_k` number (default is 50). This will be the number of results within each query to take into account while computing the performance metrics in monitoring.  

Unless the prediction column was part of your baseline dataset, you must provide the minimum and maximum values predictions can take in a dictionary format (see below).  

If your target is categorical (string), you need to provide the `categorical_target_class_details` argument. If your target is numerical and you don''t specify this argument, Fiddler will infer it.   

This will be the list of possible values for the target **ordered**. The first element should be the least relevant target level, the last element should be the most relevant target level.


```python
target = ''click_bool''
features = list(df.drop(columns=[''click_bool'', ''score'']).columns)

model_info = fdl.ModelInfo.from_dataset_info(
    dataset_info=client.get_dataset_info(project_id=PROJECT_ID, dataset_id=DATASET_ID),
    target=target,
    features=features,
    input_type=fdl.ModelInputType.TABULAR,
    model_task=fdl.ModelTask.RANKING,
    outputs={''score'':[-5.0, 3.0]},
    group_by=''srch_id'',
    ranking_top_k=20,
    categorical_target_class_details=[0, 1]
)

# inspect model info and modify as needed

First, you need to construct a `fdl.ModelInfo` object for the ranking model. This object includes information such as the project ID, dataset ID, model ID, model task, model features, target, outputs, and more. You can find an example of how to construct this object in the documentation.

Once you have the `fdl.ModelInfo` object, you can use the `client.add_model()` function to add the model to Fiddler. This function requires parameters such as the project ID, dataset ID, model ID, and the `fdl.ModelInfo` object.

Please note that when onboarding a ranking model, you must specify a `group_by` argument to the `fdl.ModelInfo` object. This argument tells Fiddler which column should be used for grouping items so that they may be ranked within a group.

For more details and examples, please refer to the [Ranking documentation](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/ranking).

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform''s core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Analyze_** — Analyze the behavior of your model in aggregate or with respect to specific segments of your population. Read the [Analytics](doc:analytics-ui) documentation for more details.
- **_Explain_** — Generate “point” or prediction-level explanations on your training or production data for insight into how each model decision was made. Read the [Explainability](doc:explainability-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Evaluate_** — View your model’s performance on its training and test sets for quick validation prior to deployment. Read the [Evaluation](doc:evaluation-ui) documentation for more details.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

![](https://files.readme.io/f1dbcf6-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.15_PM.png)

You can also pass the above information to your Fiddler administrator via your okta.yml file. 

## Logging into Fiddler:

Once a Fiddler administrator has successfully set up a deployment for your organization using your given Okta credentials, you should see the “Sign in with SSO” button enabled. When this button is clicked, you should be navigated to an Okta login screen. Once successfully authenticated, and assuming you have been granted access to Fiddler through Okta, you should be able to login to Fiddler.

NOTES:

1. To be able to login with SSO, it is initially required for the user to register with Fiddler Application. Upon successful registration, the users will be able to login using SSO.
2. The only information Fiddler stores from Okta based logins is a user’s first name, last name, email address, and OIDC token.
3. Fiddler does not currently support using Okta based login through its API (see fiddler-client). In order to use an Okta based account through Fiddler''s API, use a valid access token which can be created and copied on the “Credentials” tab on Fiddler’s “Settings” page.  Document:  ---

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

```python Connecting the Client with a fiddler.ini file

```","To begin using Fiddler, you can connect to the Fiddler platform using the Fiddler Client. The Fiddler Client provides methods for sending and receiving data to and from the Fiddler platform. You can connect to Fiddler directly from a Python notebook or automated pipeline using the Python Client provided by Fiddler.

To connect to Fiddler, you can use the `FiddlerApi` class from the `fiddler` package. You can pass the necessary information such as the Fiddler URL, organization ID, and authentication token directly into the function call. Here''s an example:

```python
import fiddler as fdl

URL = ''https://app.fiddler.ai''
ORG_ID = ''my_org''
AUTH_TOKEN = ''p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58''

client = fdl.FiddlerApi(
    url=URL,
    org_id=ORG_ID,
    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN
)
```

You can also authenticate with Fiddler by storing the necessary information in a file named `fiddler.ini`. This file should be stored in the same directory as your notebook or script. Here''s an example of writing the `fiddler.ini` file:

```python
%%writefile fiddler.ini

[FIDDLER]
url = https://app.fiddler.ai
org_id = my_org
auth_token = p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58
```

Once you have the `fiddler.ini` file, you can connect to Fiddler by simply creating an instance of the `FiddlerApi` class without passing any arguments:

```python
client = fdl.FiddlerApi()
```

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below.

**Projects** represent your organization''s distinct AI applications or use cases. Within Fiddler, Projects house all the **Models** specific to a given application, and thus serve as a jumping-off point for the majority of Fiddler’s model monitoring and explainability features.

Go ahead and click on the _Lending project_ to navigate to the Project Overview page.

Here you can see a list of the models contained within the Lending project, as well as a project dashboard to which analyze charts can be pinned. Go ahead and click the “logreg-all” model.

![](https://files.readme.io/f3e024d-image.png)

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform''s core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Analyze_** — Analyze the behavior of your model in aggregate or with respect to specific segments of your population. Read the [Analytics](doc:analytics-ui) documentation for more details.
- **_Explain_** — Generate “point” or prediction-level explanations on your training or production data for insight into how each model decision was made. Read the [Explainability](doc:explainability-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Evaluate_** — View your model’s performance on its training and test sets for quick validation prior to deployment. Read the [Evaluation](doc:evaluation-ui) documentation for more details.

## 3. Add information about your model

Now it''s time to add details about your model with Fiddler. We do so by first creating a **ModelInfo Object** that helps Fiddler understand **how your model operates**.
  
*Just include:*
1. The **task** your model is performing (regression, binary classification, etc.)
2. The **target** (ground truth) column
3. The **output** (prediction) column
4. The **feature** columns
5. Any **metadata** columns
6. Any **decision** columns (these measures the direct business decisions made as result of the model''s prediction)

```python
# Specify task
model_task = ''binary''

if model_task == ''regression'':
    model_task = fdl.ModelTask.REGRESSION
    
elif model_task == ''binary'':
    model_task = fdl.ModelTask.BINARY_CLASSIFICATION

elif model_task == ''multiclass'':
    model_task = fdl.ModelTask.MULTICLASS_CLASSIFICATION

    
# Specify column types
target = ''churn''
outputs = [''predicted_churn'']
decision_cols = [''decision'']
features = [''geography'', ''gender'', ''age'', ''tenure'', ''balance'', ''numofproducts'', ''hascrcard'', ''isactivemember'', ''estimatedsalary'']
    
# Generate ModelInfo
model_info = fdl.ModelInfo.from_dataset_info(
    dataset_info=dataset_info,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_task=model_task,
    target=target,
    categorical_target_class_details=''yes'',
    outputs=outputs,
    decision_cols=decision_cols,
    features=features
)
model_info
```

After ModelInfo object is created to save your model information, use the client''s *add_model* call to add the generated details about your model. 

**Note:** You will need to specify a unique model ID.


```python
MODEL_ID = ''churn_classifier''

client.add_model(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    model_info=model_info
)
```

On the project page, you should now be able to see the newly created model. Notice how without uploading model or creating surrogate model, you can only explore monitoring capabilities.

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## 4. Either upload your own model or generate a surrogate model

With the above step, your model is added to Fiddler which means that for a given *project_id*, your given *model_id* now holds *ModelInfo* about the model you care about. 

In order to be able to run predictions for explainability analysis, however, you will need to upload your model file. If you just want to explore the XAI capabilities without providing your model to Fiddler, you can also generate a surrogate model which tries to mimic your model based on the details provided.

MODEL_ID = ''churn_classifier''

client.add_model(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    model_info=model_info
)
```

On the project page, you should now be able to see the newly created model. Notice how without uploading model or creating surrogate model, you can only explore monitoring capabilities.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/main/quickstart/images/xai_add_model.png?raw=true"" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## 4. Either upload your own model or generate a surrogate model

With the above step, your model is added to Fiddler which means that for a given *project_id*, your given *model_id* now holds *ModelInfo* about the model you care about. 

In order to be able to run predictions for explainability analysis, however, you will need to upload your model file. If you just want to explore the XAI capabilities without providing your model to Fiddler, you can also generate a surrogate model which tries to mimic your model based on the details provided. 

In this quickstart, we will go with generating a surrogate model based on the  Document:  ---

Machine learning-based fraud detection models have been proven to be more effective than humans when it comes to detecting fraud. However, if left unattended, the performance of fraud detection models can degrade over time leading to big losses for the company and dissatisfied customers.  
The **Fiddler AI Observability** platform provides a variety of tools that can be used to monitor, explain, analyze, and improve the performance of your fraud detection model.

## Monitoring

### Drift Detection

- **Class-imbalanced Data** - Fraud use cases suffer from highly imbalanced data. Users can specify model weights on a global or event level to improve drift detection. Please see more information in  [Class-Imbalanced Data](https://docs.fiddler.ai/v1.3/docs/class-imbalanced-data). 

- **Feature Impact** - Tells us the contribution of features to the model''s prediction, averaged over the baseline dataset. The contribution is calculated using [random ablation feature impact](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00174.pdf).

- **Feature Drift** - Tells us how much a feature is drifting away from the baseline dataset for the time period of interest. For more information on how drift metrics are calculated, see [Data Drift](doc:data-drift-platform).

- **Prediction Drift Impact** - A heuristic calculated by taking the product of Feature Impact and Feature Drift. The higher the score the more this feature contributed to the prediction value drift.

### Performance Metrics

Accuracy might not be a good measure of model performance in the case of fraud detection as most of the cases are non-fraud. Therefore, we use monitor metrics like: 

1. **Recall** - How many of the non-fraudulent cases were actually detected as fraud? A low recall value might lead to an increased number of cases for review even though all the fraud cases were predicted correctly.
2. **False Positive Rate** - Non-Fraud cases labeled as fraud, high FPR rate leads to dissatisfied customers.

### Data Integrity

- **Range Violations** - This metric shows the percentage of data in the selected production data that has violated the range specified in the baseline data through [`DatasetInfo`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#fdl-datasetinfo) API.
- **Missing Value Violations** - This metric shows the percentage of missing data for a feature in the selected production data.
- **Type Violations** - This metric shows the percentage of data in the selected production data that has violated the type specified in the baseline data through the DatasetInfo API.

#### Step 7 - Actions

We discovered that the prediction drift and performance drop were due to the introduction of a new value in the ‘Category’ column. We can take steps so that we could identify this kind of issue in the future before it can result in business impact.

##### Setting up Alerts

In the ‘Analyze’ tab, we can set up alerts to notify us of as soon as a certain data issue happens. For example, for the case we discussed, we can set up alerts as shown below to alert us when the range violation increases beyond a certain threshold (e.g.-5%).

    }
  ]
}
[/block]

These alerts can further influence the retraining of the ML model, we can retrain the model including the new data so the newly trained model contains the ‘insurance’ category value. This should result in improved performance.

### Conclusion

Undetected fraud cases can lead to losses for the company and customers, not to mention damage reputation and relationship with customers. The Fiddler AI Observability platform can be used to identify the pitfalls in your ML model and mitigate them before they have an impact on your business.

In this walkthrough, we investigated one such issue with a fraud detection model where a data integrity issue caused the performance of the ML model to drop.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`run_feature_importance`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#client-run_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `n_inputs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

Feature impact and importance are displayed as percentages of all attributions.

The following is an example of feature impact for a model predicting the likelihood of successful loan repayment:

Two types of visualization are available:

- **_Word cloud_** — Displays a word cloud of top 150 words from a collection of text for this model. Fiddler provides three options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**:  The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.
  - **Occurrences**: The number of times a word is present in the corpus of text.

- **_Bar chart_** — Displays the impact for the **Top N** words. By default, only words with at least 15 occurrences are displayed. This number can be modified in the UI and will be reflected in real time in the bar chart. Fiddler provides two options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality. Since positive and negative directionalities can cancel out, Fiddler provides a histogram of the individual impact, which can be found by clicking on the word.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**: The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.

The following image shows an example of word impact for a sentiment analysis model:

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

Feature impact and importance are displayed as percentages of all attributions.

The following is an example of feature impact for a model predicting the likelihood of successful loan repayment:

![](https://files.readme.io/2548d18-Global-Expln-Tabular.png ""Global-Expln-Tabular.png"")

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`run_feature_importance`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#client-run_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `n_inputs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Two types of visualization are available:

- **_Word cloud_** — Displays a word cloud of top 150 words from a collection of text for this model. Fiddler provides three options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**:  The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.
  - **Occurrences**: The number of times a word is present in the corpus of text.

- **_Bar chart_** — Displays the impact for the **Top N** words. By default, only words with at least 15 occurrences are displayed. This number can be modified in the UI and will be reflected in real time in the bar chart. Fiddler provides two options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality. Since positive and negative directionalities can cancel out, Fiddler provides a histogram of the individual impact, which can be found by clicking on the word.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

We discovered there was an issue with the ‘Category’ column, wherein a new value was discovered in the production data. This led to the performance drop in the data likely due to the range violation. We suggest two steps to mitigate this issue:

1. Setting up ‘alerts’ to identify similar issues in data integrity
2. Retraining the ML model after including the new data (with the ground truth labels) to teach the model of the new values

Datasets (or baseline datasets) are used for making comparisons with production data.

A baseline dataset should be sampled from your model''s training set, so it can serve as a representation of what the model expects to see in production.

For more information, see [Uploading a Baseline Dataset](doc:uploading-a-baseline-dataset).

Datasets (or baseline datasets) are used for making comparisons with production data.

A baseline dataset should be sampled from your model''s training set, so it can serve as a representation of what the model expects to see in production.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

1. Data Drift: Monitor the drift in the distribution of features of interest using metrics like Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) or Population Stability Index (PSI). This helps identify distributional shifts in the data that could impact model performance. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/data-drift-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

2. Performance: Monitor model performance metrics specific to your model. This could include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. Monitoring these metrics helps identify any decline in model performance. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/performance-tracking-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

3. Data Integrity Violations: Monitor data integrity issues such as range violations, missing values, or unexpected values in the data. This helps identify any issues that could harm model performance. [Reference](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/data-integrity-platform#what-is-being-tracked)

## Regression Models

To measure model performance for regression tasks, we provide some useful performance metrics and tools.

![](https://files.readme.io/e7e7a01-Model_Regression.png ""Model_Regression.png"")

- **_Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)_**
  - Measures the variation between the predicted and the actual value.
  - RMSE = SQRT[Sum of all observation (predicted value - actual value)^2/number of observations]
- **_Mean Absolute Error (MAE)_**
  - Measures the average magnitude of the error in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
  - MAE = Sum of all observation[Abs(predicted value - actual value)]/number of observations
- **_Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>)_**
  - Measures how much better the model''s predictions are than just predicting a single value for all examples.
  - R<sup>2</sup> = variance explained by the model / total variance
- **_Prediction Scatterplot_**
  - Plots the predicted values against the actual values. The more closely the plot hugs the y=x line, the better the fit of the model.
- **_Error Distribution_**
  - A histogram showing the distribution of errors (differences between model predictions and actuals). The closer to 0 the errors are, the better the fit of the model.

## Classification Models

To measure model performance for classification tasks, we provide some useful performance metrics and tools.

![](https://files.readme.io/b60acfb-Model_Classification.png ""Model_Classification.png"")

- **_Precision_**
  - Measures the proportion of positive predictions which were correctly classified.
- **_Recall_**
  - Measures the proportion of positive examples which were correctly classified.
- **_Accuracy_**
  - Measures the proportion of all examples which were correctly classified.
- **_F1-Score_**
  - Measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall. In the multi-class classification case, Fiddler computes micro F1-Score.
- **_AUC_**
  - Measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
- **_Log Loss_**
  - Measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction input is a probability value between 0 and 1. The goal of the ML model is to minimize this value.
- **_Confusion Matrix_**
  - A table that shows how many predicted and actual values exist for different classes. Also referred as an error matrix.
- **_Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve_**
  - A graph showing the performance of a classification model at different classification thresholds. Plots the true positive rate (TPR), also known as recall, against the false positive rate (FPR).
- **_Precision-Recall Curve_**
  - A graph that plots the precision against the recall for different classification thresholds.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

The pass rate is the rate of positive outcome for a given group. It is defined as follow:

`pass rate = passed / (num of ppl in the group)`

If the decisions are fair, the pass rates should be the same.

## Group Benefit

Group benefit aims to measure the rate at which a particular event is predicted to occur within a subgroup compared to the rate at which it actually occurs.

Mathematically, group benefit for a given group is defined as follows:

`Group Benefit = (TP+FP) / (TP + FN).`

Group benefit equality compares the group benefit between two groups. If the two groups are treated equally, the group benefit should be the same.

## Equal Opportunity

Equal opportunity means that all people will be treated equally or similarly and not disadvantaged by prejudices or bias.

Mathematically, equal opportunity compares the true positive rate (TPR) between two groups. TPR is the probability that an actual positive will test positive. The true positive rate is defined as follows:

`TPR = TP/(TP+FN)`

If the two groups are treated equally, the TPR should be the same.

## Intersectional Fairness

We believe fairness should be ensured to all subgroups of the population. We extended the classical metrics (which are defined for two classes) to multiple classes. In addition, we allow multiple protected features (e.g. race _and_ gender). By measuring fairness along overlapping dimensions, we introduce the concept of intersectional fairness.

To understand why we decided to go with intersectional fairness, we can take a simple example. In the figure below, we observe that equal numbers of black and white people pass. Similarly, there is an equal number of men and women passing. However, this classification is unfair because we don’t have any black women and white men that passed, and all black men and white women passed. Here, we observe bias within subgroups when we take race and gender as protected attributes.

The EEOC provides examples of past intersectional discrimination/harassment cases.[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#reference)

## Model Behavior

In addition to the fairness metrics, we provide information about model outcomes and model performance for each subgroup. 

## Dataset Fairness

We also provide a section for dataset fairness, with a mutual information matrix and a label distribution. Note that this is a pre-modeling step.

**Mutual information **gives information about existing dependence in your dataset between the protected attributes and the remaining features. We are displaying Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). This metric is symmetric, and has values between 0 and 1, where 1 means perfect dependency.

This guide will walk you through the basic onboarding steps required to use Fiddler for model monitoring, **using sample data provided by Fiddler**.  

**Note**: This guide does not upload a model artifact or create a surrogate model, both of which are supported by Fiddler.  As a result, this guide won''t allow you to explore explainability within the platform.

Fiddler allows your team to monitor, explain and analyze your models developed and deployed in [Databricks Workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/introduction/index.html) by integrating with [MLFlow](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/index.html) for model asset management and utilizing Databricks Spark environment for data management. 

To validate and monitor models built on Databricks using Fiddler, you can follow these steps:

1. [Creating a Fiddler Project](doc:databricks-integration#creating-a-fiddler-project)
2. [Uploading a Baseline Dataset](doc:databricks-integration#uploading-a-baseline-dataset)
3. [Adding Model Information ](doc:databricks-integration#adding-model-information)
4. [Uploading Model Files (for Explainability)](doc:databricks-integration#uploading-model-files)
5. [Publishing Events](doc:databricks-integration#publishing-events)
   1. Batch Models 
   2. Live Models 

## Creating a Fiddler Project

Launch a [Databricks notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/index.html) from your workspace and run the following code:

```python
!pip install -q fiddler-client
import fiddler as fdl
```

Now that you have the Fiddler library installed, you can connect to your Fiddler environment. Please use the [UI administration guide](doc:administration-ui) to help you find your Fiddler credentials.

```python
URL = """"
ORG_ID = """"
AUTH_TOKEN = """"
client = fdl.FiddlerApi(url=URL, org_id=ORG_ID, auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN)
```

Finally, you can set up a new project using:

```python
client.create_project(""YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"")
```

## Uploading a Baseline Dataset

You can grab your baseline dataset from a[ delta table](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/dataframes-python.html) and share it with Fiddler as a baseline dataset:

```python
baseline_dataset = spark.read.table(""YOUR_DATASET"").select(""*"").toPandas()

dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(baseline_upload, max_inferred_cardinality=100)
  
client.upload_dataset(
  project_id=PROJECT_ID,
  dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
  dataset={''baseline'': baseline_upload},
  info=dataset_info)
```

## Adding Model Information

Using the **[MLFlow API](https://docs.databricks.com/reference/mlflow-api.html) ** you can query the model registry and get the **model signature** which describes the inputs and outputs as a dictionary. You can use this dictionary to build out the [ModelInfo](ref:fdlmodelinfo) object required to the model to Fiddler:

```python Python
import mlflow 
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient() #initiate MLFlow Client 

#Get the model URI
model_version_info = client.get_model_version(model_name, model_version)
model_uri = client.get_model_version_download_uri(model_name, model_version_info) 

#Get the Model Signature
mlflow_model_info = mlflow.models.get_model_info(model_uri)
model_inputs_schema = model_info.signature.inputs.to_dict()

Fiddler Monitoring helps you identify issues with the performance of your ML models after deployment. Fiddler Monitoring has five Metric Types which can be monitored and alerted on:

1. **Data Drift**
2. **Performance**
3. **Data Integrity**
4. **Traffic**
5. **Statistic**

## Integrate with Fiddler Monitoring

Integrating Fiddler monitoring is a four-step process:

1. **Upload dataset**

   Fiddler needs a dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring. A dataset can be uploaded to Fiddler using our UI and Python package. For more information, see:

   - [client.upload_dataset()](ref:clientupload_dataset) 

2. **Onboard model**

   Fiddler needs some specifications about your model in order to help you troubleshoot production issues. Fiddler supports a wide variety of model formats. For more information, see:

   - [client.add_model()](ref:clientadd_model) 

3. **Configure monitoring for this model**

   You will need to configure bins and alerts for your model. These will be discussed in detail below.

4. **Send traffic from your live deployed model to Fiddler**

   Use the Fiddler SDK to send us traffic from your live deployed model.

## Publish events to Fiddler

In order to send traffic to Fiddler, use the [`publish_event`](ref:clientpublish_event) API from the Fiddler SDK.

The `publish_event` API can be called in real-time right after your model inference. 

An event can contain the following:

- Inputs
- Outputs
- Target
- Decisions (categorical only)
- Metadata

These aspects of an event can be monitored on the platform.

> 📘 Info
> 
> You can also publish events as part of a batch call after the fact using the `publish_events_batch` API (click [here](ref:clientpublish_events_batch) for more information). In this case, you will need to send Fiddler the original event timestamps as to accurately populate the time series charts.

## Updating events

Fiddler supports [partial updates of events](doc:updating-events) for your **target** column. This can be useful when you don’t have access to the ground truth for your model at the time the model''s prediction is made. Other columns can only be sent at insertion time (with `update_event=False`).

Fiddler Monitoring helps you identify issues with the performance of your ML models after deployment. Fiddler Monitoring has five Metric Types which can be monitored and alerted on:

1. **Data Drift**
2. **Performance**
3. **Data Integrity**
4. **Traffic**
5. **Statistic**

## Integrate with Fiddler Monitoring

Integrating Fiddler monitoring is a four-step process:

1. **Upload dataset**

   Fiddler needs a dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring. A dataset can be uploaded to Fiddler using our UI and Python package. For more information, see:

   - [client.upload_dataset()](ref:clientupload_dataset) 

2. **Onboard model**

   Fiddler needs some specifications about your model in order to help you troubleshoot production issues. Fiddler supports a wide variety of model formats. For more information, see:

   - [client.add_model()](ref:clientadd_model) 

3. **Configure monitoring for this model**

   You will need to configure bins and alerts for your model. These will be discussed in detail below.

Fiddler supports some simple statistic metrics which can be used to monitor basic aggregations over Columns.

These can be particularly useful when you have a custom metadata field which you would like to monitor over time in addition to Fiddler''s other out-of-the-box metrics.

Specifically, we support

- Average (takes the arithmetic mean of a numeric column)
- Sum (calculates the sum of a numeric column)

These metrics can be accessed in Charts and Alerts by selecting the Statistic Metric Type.

A model needs a baseline dataset for comparing its performance and identifying any degradation. A baseline is a set of reference data that is used to compare with our current data. 

The dataset that was used to train the model is often a good starting point for a baseline. For more in-depth analysis, we may want to use a specific time period or a rolling window of production events. 

In Fiddler, **the default baseline for all monitoring metrics is the training dataset **that was associated with the model during registration. Use this default baseline if you do not anticipate any differences between training and production. [New baselines can be added to existing models using the Python client APIs](ref:add_baseline).

In order for Fiddler to monitor drift or data integrity issues in incoming production data, it needs something to compare this data to.

A baseline dataset is a **representative sample** of the kind of data you expect to see in production. It represents the ideal form of data that your model works best on.

*For this reason,* ***it should be sampled from your model’s training set.***

***

**A few things to keep in mind when designing a baseline dataset:**

* It’s important to include **enough data** to ensure you have a representative sample of the training set.
* You may want to consider **including extreme values (min/max)** of each column in your training set so you can properly monitor range violations in production data. However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).  Document:  ---

In order for Fiddler to monitor drift or data integrity issues in incoming production data, it needs something to compare this data to.

A baseline dataset is a **representative sample** of the kind of data you expect to see in production. It represents the ideal form of data that your model works best on.

*For this reason,* ***it should be sampled from your model’s training set.***

***

**A few things to keep in mind when designing a baseline dataset:**

* It’s important to include **enough data** to ensure you have a representative sample of the training set.
* You may want to consider **including extreme values (min/max)** of each column in your training set so you can properly monitor range violations in production data. However, if you choose not to, you can manually specify these ranges before upload (see [Customizing Your Dataset Schema])(doc:customizing-your-dataset-schema).  Document:  ---

Fiddler allows your team to monitor, explain and analyze your models developed and deployed in [Databricks Workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/introduction/index.html) by integrating with [MLFlow](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/index.html) for model asset management and utilizing Databricks Spark environment for data management. 

To validate and monitor models built on Databricks using Fiddler, you can follow these steps:

1. [Creating a Fiddler Project](doc:databricks-integration#creating-a-fiddler-project)
2. [Uploading a Baseline Dataset](doc:databricks-integration#uploading-a-baseline-dataset)
3. [Adding Model Information ](doc:databricks-integration#adding-model-information)
4. [Uploading Model Files (for Explainability)](doc:databricks-integration#uploading-model-files)
5. [Publishing Events](doc:databricks-integration#publishing-events)
   1. Batch Models 
   2. Live Models 

## Creating a Fiddler Project

Launch a [Databricks notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/index.html) from your workspace and run the following code:

```python
!pip install -q fiddler-client
import fiddler as fdl
```

Now that you have the Fiddler library installed, you can connect to your Fiddler environment. Please use the [UI administration guide](doc:administration-ui) to help you find your Fiddler credentials.

```python
URL = """"
ORG_ID = """"
AUTH_TOKEN = """"
client = fdl.FiddlerApi(url=URL, org_id=ORG_ID, auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN)
```

Finally, you can set up a new project using:

```python
client.create_project(""YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"")
```

## Uploading a Baseline Dataset

You can grab your baseline dataset from a[ delta table](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/dataframes-python.html) and share it with Fiddler as a baseline dataset:

```python
baseline_dataset = spark.read.table(""YOUR_DATASET"").select(""*"").toPandas()

dataset_info = fdl.DatasetInfo.from_dataframe(baseline_upload, max_inferred_cardinality=100)
  
client.upload_dataset(
  project_id=PROJECT_ID,
  dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
  dataset={''baseline'': baseline_upload},
  info=dataset_info)
```

## Adding Model Information

Using the **[MLFlow API](https://docs.databricks.com/reference/mlflow-api.html) ** you can query the model registry and get the **model signature** which describes the inputs and outputs as a dictionary. You can use this dictionary to build out the [ModelInfo](ref:fdlmodelinfo) object required to the model to Fiddler:

```python Python
import mlflow 
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient() #initiate MLFlow Client 

#Get the model URI
model_version_info = client.get_model_version(model_name, model_version)
model_uri = client.get_model_version_download_uri(model_name, model_version_info) 

#Get the Model Signature
mlflow_model_info = mlflow.models.get_model_info(model_uri)
model_inputs_schema = model_info.signature.inputs.to_dict()

```

2. Your organization ID
3. Your authorization token

Both of these can be found by clicking the URL you entered and navigating to the **Settings","To add custom baselines in Fiddler, you can use the Python client APIs. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Connect to the Fiddler API using the FiddlerApi class and provide the URL, organization ID, and authorization token. You can find these credentials in the Fiddler UI under Settings.

   Example:
   ```python
   client = fdl.FiddlerApi(url=URL, org_id=ORG_ID, auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN)
   ```

2. Create a new project using the create_project function of the FiddlerApi class. Provide a unique project ID as the parameter.

   Example:
   ```python
   PROJECT_ID = ''my_project''
   client.create_project(PROJECT_ID)
   ```

3. Upload a baseline dataset using the upload_dataset function of the FiddlerApi class. Provide the project ID, dataset ID, baseline dataset as a pandas DataFrame, and a DatasetInfo object that contains information about the dataset.

   Example:
   ```python
   DATASET_ID = ''my_dataset''
   client.upload_dataset(
       project_id=PROJECT_ID,
       dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
       dataset={''baseline'': baseline_df},
       info=dataset_info
   )
   ```

You can find more information about designing a baseline dataset and customizing the dataset schema in the Fiddler documentation: [Designing a Baseline Dataset](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/designing-a-baseline-dataset) and [Customizing Your Dataset Schema](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/customizing-your-dataset-schema).

**Projects** represent your organization''s distinct AI applications or use cases. Within Fiddler, Projects house all the **Models** specific to a given application, and thus serve as a jumping-off point for the majority of Fiddler’s model monitoring and explainability features.

Go ahead and click on the _Lending project_ to navigate to the Project Overview page.

![](https://files.readme.io/b008f03-image.png)

Here you can see a list of the models contained within the Lending project, as well as a project dashboard to which analyze charts can be pinned. Go ahead and click the “logreg-all” model.

![](https://files.readme.io/f3e024d-image.png)

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform''s core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Analyze_** — Analyze the behavior of your model in aggregate or with respect to specific segments of your population. Read the [Analytics](doc:analytics-ui) documentation for more details.
- **_Explain_** — Generate “point” or prediction-level explanations on your training or production data for insight into how each model decision was made. Read the [Explainability](doc:explainability-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Evaluate_** — View your model’s performance on its training and test sets for quick validation prior to deployment. Read the [Evaluation](doc:evaluation-ui) documentation for more details.

This guide will walk you through the basic onboarding steps required to use Fiddler for model monitoring, **using sample data provided by Fiddler**.  

**Note**: This guide does not upload a model artifact or create a surrogate model, both of which are supported by Fiddler.  As a result, this guide won''t allow you to explore explainability within the platform.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

## Overview

These instructions will help administrators configure Fiddler to be used with an existing Okta single sign on application.

## Okta Setup:

First, you must create an OIDC based application within Okta. Your application will require a callback URL during setup time. This URL will be provided to you by a Fiddler administrator. Your application should grant ""Authorization Code"" permissions to a client acting on behalf of a user. See the image below for how your setup might look like:

![](https://files.readme.io/b7b67fe-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.22.36_PM.png)

This is the stage where you can allow certain users of your organization access to Fiddler through Okta. You can use the ""Group Assignments"" field to choose unique sets of organization members to grant access to. This setup stage will also allow for Role Based Access Control (i.e. RBAC) based on specific groups using your application.

Once your application has been set up, a Fiddler administrator will need to receive the following information and credentials:

- Okta domain
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Okta Account Type (default or custom)

All of the above can be obtained from your Okta application dashboard, as shown in the pictures below:

![](https://files.readme.io/6442827-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.03_PM.png)

![](https://files.readme.io/f1dbcf6-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.30.15_PM.png)

You can also pass the above information to your Fiddler administrator via your okta.yml file. 

## Logging into Fiddler:

Once a Fiddler administrator has successfully set up a deployment for your organization using your given Okta credentials, you should see the “Sign in with SSO” button enabled. When this button is clicked, you should be navigated to an Okta login screen. Once successfully authenticated, and assuming you have been granted access to Fiddler through Okta, you should be able to login to Fiddler.

![](https://files.readme.io/c96a709-Screen_Shot_2022-08-07_at_10.36.40_PM.png)

NOTES:

1. To be able to login with SSO, it is initially required for the user to register with Fiddler Application. Upon successful registration, the users will be able to login using SSO.
2. The only information Fiddler stores from Okta based logins is a user’s first name, last name, email address, and OIDC token.
3. Fiddler does not currently support using Okta based login through its API (see fiddler-client). In order to use an Okta based account through Fiddler''s API, use a valid access token which can be created and copied on the “Credentials” tab on Fiddler’s “Settings” page.  Document:  ---

## Invite a user to Fiddler

> 🚧 
> 
> To invite a user to Fiddler, you will need [Administrator permissions](doc:authorization-and-access-control). If you do not have access to an Administrator account, please contact your server administrator.

Inviting a user is easy. From anywhere on the Fiddler UI, just follow these four steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page.
2. Click on the **Access** tab.
3. Click on the **Invitations** section.
4. Click on the plus icon on the right.

![](https://files.readme.io/3bd55c1-invite_a_user.png ""invite_a_user.png"")

When you click on the plus icon, an invite popup screen will appear as follows:

![](https://files.readme.io/8e3806f-Screen_Shot_2023-04-11_at_12.27.32_PM.png)

Once the invitation has been sent, the user should receive a signup link at the email provided.

## Getting an invitation link

In the case where the email address is not associated with an inbox, you can get the invite link by clicking **Copy invite link** after the invitation has been created.

![](https://files.readme.io/25b8659-get_invite_link.png ""get_invite_link.png"")

## What if I''m using SSO?

Whether you are using normal sign-on or single sign-on, **the process for inviting users is the same**.

If using SSO, a user should still sign up using their invitation link. Once they have created their account, their SSO login will be enabled.  Document:  ---

This notebook will show you how Fiddler enables monitoring and explainability for a Ranking model. This notebook uses a dataset from Expedia that includes shopping and purchase data with information on price competitiveness. The data are organized around a set of “search result impressions”, or the ordered list of hotels that the user sees after they search for a hotel on the Expedia website.

Suppose you would like to upload a model artifact for a **ranking model**.

Following is an example of what the `package.py` script may look like.

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class ModelPackage:

    def __init__(self):
        self.output_columns = [''score'']
        with open(PACKAGE_PATH / ''model.pkl'', ''rb'') as infile:
            self.model = pickle.load(infile)
    
    def predict(self, input_df):
        pred = self.model.predict(input_df)
        return pd.DataFrame(pred, columns=self.output_columns)
    
def get_model():
    return ModelPackage()
```

Here, we are assuming that the model prediction column that has been specified in the [`fdl.ModelInfo`](ref:fdlmodelinfo) object is called `score`.

Document:  slug: ""performance-tracking-platform""  the ranking of the retrieved items, by discounting the relevance scores of items at lower ranks                            |

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

This notebook provides an example of how Fiddler enables monitoring and explainability for a ranking model. It uses a dataset from Expedia that includes shopping and purchase data with information on price competitiveness. The notebook demonstrates how to onboard a ranking model onto Fiddler and provides code examples for creating a `package.py` script to upload the model artifact.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model''s behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8e4f81-Tabular_Explain.png ""Tabular_Explain.png"")

A brief tour of the features above:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it''s approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

**Two numbers** accompany each feature’s attribution bar in the UI.  Document:  ---

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model''s behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8e4f81-Tabular_Explain.png ""Tabular_Explain.png"")

A brief tour of the features above:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it''s approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

**Two numbers** accompany each feature’s attribution bar in the UI.  Document:  ---

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_importance`](ref:clientget_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `num_refs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

[^1]\: _Join our [community Slack](https://www.fiddler.ai/slackinvite) to ask any questions_","Fiddler''s LLM (Local Linear Model) strategy is a technique used to explain individual predictions made by machine learning models. It involves creating a local linear approximation of the model''s behavior around a specific data point to understand the factors that contribute to the prediction. This strategy helps in understanding the model''s decision-making process and provides interpretability to the predictions.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_importance`](ref:clientget_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `num_refs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

Feature impact and importance are displayed as percentages of all attributions.

The following is an example of feature impact for a model predicting the likelihood of successful loan repayment:

Two types of visualization are available:

- **_Word cloud_** — Displays a word cloud of top 150 words from a collection of text for this model. Fiddler provides three options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**:  The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.
  - **Occurrences**: The number of times a word is present in the corpus of text.

- **_Bar chart_** — Displays the impact for the **Top N** words. By default, only words with at least 15 occurrences are displayed. This number can be modified in the UI and will be reflected in real time in the bar chart. Fiddler provides two options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality. Since positive and negative directionalities can cancel out, Fiddler provides a histogram of the individual impact, which can be found by clicking on the word.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**: The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.

The following image shows an example of word impact for a sentiment analysis model:

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

Feature impact and importance are displayed as percentages of all attributions.

The following is an example of feature impact for a model predicting the likelihood of successful loan repayment:

![](https://files.readme.io/2548d18-Global-Expln-Tabular.png ""Global-Expln-Tabular.png"")

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_impact`](ref:clientget_feature_impact) function from the Fiddler API client, the number of input sentences can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Two types of visualization are available:

- **_Word cloud_** — Displays a word cloud of top 150 words from a collection of text for this model. Fiddler provides three options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**:  The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.
  - **Occurrences**: The number of times a word is present in the corpus of text.

- **_Bar chart_** — Displays the impact for the **Top N** words. By default, only words with at least 15 occurrences are displayed. This number can be modified in the UI and will be reflected in real time in the bar chart. Fiddler provides two options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality. Since positive and negative directionalities can cancel out, Fiddler provides a histogram of the individual impact, which can be found by clicking on the word.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**: The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.

The following image shows an example of word impact for a sentiment analysis model:

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_importance`](ref:clientget_feature_importance) function from the Fiddler API client, the argument `num_refs` can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

> 📘 Info
> 
> For speed performance, Fiddler uses a random corpus of 200 documents from the dataset. When using the [`get_feature_impact`](ref:clientget_feature_impact) function from the Fiddler API client, the number of input sentences can be changed to use a bigger corpus of texts.

Two types of visualization are available:

- **_Word cloud_** — Displays a word cloud of top 150 words from a collection of text for this model. Fiddler provides three options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**:  The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.
  - **Occurrences**: The number of times a word is present in the corpus of text.

- **_Bar chart_** — Displays the impact for the **Top N** words. By default, only words with at least 15 occurrences are displayed. This number can be modified in the UI and will be reflected in real time in the bar chart. Fiddler provides two options:
  - **Average change**: The average impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This takes into account the impact''s directionality. Since positive and negative directionalities can cancel out, Fiddler provides a histogram of the individual impact, which can be found by clicking on the word.
  - **Average absolute feature impact**: The average absolute impact of a word in the corpus of documents. This only takes the absolute impact of the word into account, and not its directionality.

If we look at example 11, we can see that the output probability value was 0 (predicted as fraud according to the threshold of 0.5) but the actual value was ‘not fraud’. 

The bulb icon will take us to the ‘Explain’ tab. Here we can see that the ‘category’ value contributed to the model predicting the case as ‘fraud’.

#### Step 7 - Actions

We discovered that the prediction drift and performance drop were due to the introduction of a new value in the ‘Category’ column. We can take steps so that we could identify this kind of issue in the future before it can result in business impact.

##### Setting up Alerts

In the ‘Analyze’ tab, we can set up alerts to notify us of as soon as a certain data issue happens. For example, for the case we discussed, we can set up alerts as shown below to alert us when the range violation increases beyond a certain threshold (e.g.-5%).

[block:image]
{
  ""images"": [

      ],
      ""align"": ""center"",
      ""caption"": ""Setting up Alerts""
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


These alerts can further influence the retraining of the ML model, we can retrain the model including the new data so the newly trained model contains the ‘insurance’ category value. This should result in improved performance.

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.  Document:  ---

Fiddler deploys into your private cloud''s existing Kubernetes clusters, for which the minimum system requirements can be found [here](doc:technical-requirements).  Fiddler supports deployment into Kubernetes in AWS, Azure, or GCP.  All services of the Fiddler platform are containerized in order to eliminate reliance on other cloud services and to reduce the deployment and maintenance friction of the platform.  This includes storage services like object storage and databases as well as system monitoring services like Grafana.  

Updates to the Fiddler containers is accomplished through a shared container registry (that Fiddler is provided access to).  Updates to the containers are orchestrated using Helm charts.

A full-stack deployment of Fiddler is shown in the diagram below. 

![](https://files.readme.io/7cbfe31-reference_architecture.png)

The Fiddler system components are deployed within a single namespace on a Kubernetes cluster, using the official Fiddler Helm chart.

- Fiddler core infrastructure relies on persistent volumes provided within the Kubernetes cluster. We recommend using encrypted storage volumes wherever possible.
- Fiddler may be configured to utilize external infrastructure in a self-hosted environment, such as existing PostgresQL servers, but this is not required as all services are containerized by default.
- Full-stack ""any-prem"" Fiddler includes observability infrastructure to monitor Fiddler system health and performance. These mainstream observability components may be integrated with external observability systems to support administration in a self-hosted environment.
- HTTP traffic to the Fiddler system is handled by an L4 or L7 load balancer or other proxy. TLS termination should usually occur outside the Fiddler system.

Once the platform is running, end users can interface with the Fiddler platform using their browser, the [Fiddler Python client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), or Fiddler''s RESTful APIs.","Fiddler helps with root cause analysis by providing data insights and visualizations that can help identify the root cause of issues in machine learning models. It allows users to analyze model performance, detect prediction drift, and identify data integrity issues that may be impacting model performance. By monitoring performance metrics and setting up alerts, users can be notified of any data issues that may be affecting the model. Fiddler also provides explanations for individual predictions, allowing users to understand why a model made a certain prediction. This can help identify specific features or data points that are contributing to incorrect predictions. Overall, Fiddler''s observability platform provides the tools and insights needed to investigate and mitigate issues in machine learning models.

#### Step 7 - Actions

We discovered that the prediction drift and performance drop were due to the introduction of a new value in the ‘Category’ column. We can take steps so that we could identify this kind of issue in the future before it can result in business impact.

##### Setting up Alerts

In the ‘Analyze’ tab, we can set up alerts to notify us of as soon as a certain data issue happens. For example, for the case we discussed, we can set up alerts as shown below to alert us when the range violation increases beyond a certain threshold (e.g.-5%).

[block:image]

      ],
      ""align"": ""center"",
      ""caption"": ""Setting up Alerts""
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


These alerts can further influence the retraining of the ML model, we can retrain the model including the new data so the newly trained model contains the ‘insurance’ category value. This should result in improved performance.

### Conclusion

Undetected fraud cases can lead to losses for the company and customers, not to mention damage reputation and relationship with customers. The Fiddler AI Observability platform can be used to identify the pitfalls in your ML model and mitigate them before they have an impact on your business.

It is often the case that a model’s performance will degrade over time. We can use the Fiddler AI Observability platform to monitor the model’s performance in production, look at various metrics and also provide explanations to predictions on various data points. In this walkthrough, we will look at a few scenarios common to a fraud model when monitoring for performance. We will show how you would:

1. Get baseline and production data onto the Fiddler Platform
2. Monitor drift for various features
3. Monitor performance metrics associated with fraud detection like recall, false-positive rate
4. Monitor data integrity Issues like range violations
5. Provide point explanations to the mislabelled points
6. Get to the root cause of the issues

In the fraud detection example, Fiddler identifies a data integrity issue that caused the performance of the ML model to drop. By analyzing the point explanations, Fiddler identifies that the introduction of a new value in the ''Category'' column contributed to the model predicting cases as fraud incorrectly. This helps in understanding the root cause of the performance degradation and taking steps to mitigate the issue in the future.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- The volume of decisions made on the basis of the predictions give visibility into the business impact of the model.

## What steps should I take based on this information?

- For decisions, if there is an increase or decrease in approvals, we can cross-check with the average prediction and prediction drift trendlines on the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift). In general, the average prediction value should increase with an increase in the number of approvals, and vice-versa.
- For changes in model performance—again, the best way to cross-verify the results is by checking the [Data Drift Tab](doc:data-drift) ). Once you confirm that the performance issue is not due to the data, you need to assess if the change in performance is due to temporary factors, or due to longer-lasting issues.
- You can check if there are any lightweight changes you can make to help recover performance—for example, you could try modifying the decision threshold.
- Retraining the model with the latest data and redeploying it is usually the solution that yields the best results, although it may be time-consuming and expensive.

This notebook will show you how Fiddler enables monitoring and explainability for a Ranking model. This notebook uses a dataset from Expedia that includes shopping and purchase data with information on price competitiveness. The data are organized around a set of “search result impressions”, or the ordered list of hotels that the user sees after they search for a hotel on the Expedia website.

Model performance evaluation is one of the key tasks in the ML model lifecycle. A model''s performance indicates how successful the model is at making useful predictions on data.

Once your trained model is loaded into Fiddler, click on **Evaluate** to see its performance.

## Regression Models

To measure model performance for regression tasks, we provide some useful performance metrics and tools.

![](https://files.readme.io/e7e7a01-Model_Regression.png ""Model_Regression.png"")

- **_Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)_**
  - Measures the variation between the predicted and the actual value.
  - RMSE = SQRT[Sum of all observation (predicted value - actual value)^2/number of observations]
- **_Mean Absolute Error (MAE)_**
  - Measures the average magnitude of the error in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
  - MAE = Sum of all observation[Abs(predicted value - actual value)]/number of observations
- **_Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>)_**
  - Measures how much better the model''s predictions are than just predicting a single value for all examples.
  - R<sup>2</sup> = variance explained by the model / total variance
- **_Prediction Scatterplot_**
  - Plots the predicted values against the actual values. The more closely the plot hugs the y=x line, the better the fit of the model.
- **_Error Distribution_**
  - A histogram showing the distribution of errors (differences between model predictions and actuals). The closer to 0 the errors are, the better the fit of the model.

## Classification Models

To measure model performance for classification tasks, we provide some useful performance metrics and tools.

![](https://files.readme.io/b60acfb-Model_Classification.png ""Model_Classification.png"")

- **_Precision_**
  - Measures the proportion of positive predictions which were correctly classified.
- **_Recall_**
  - Measures the proportion of positive examples which were correctly classified.
- **_Accuracy_**
  - Measures the proportion of all examples which were correctly classified.
- **_F1-Score_**
  - Measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall. In the multi-class classification case, Fiddler computes micro F1-Score.
- **_AUC_**
  - Measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
- **_Log Loss_**
  - Measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction input is a probability value between 0 and 1. The goal of the ML model is to minimize this value.
- **_Confusion Matrix_**
  - A table that shows how many predicted and actual values exist for different classes. Also referred as an error matrix.
- **_Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve_**
  - A graph showing the performance of a classification model at different classification thresholds. Plots the true positive rate (TPR), also known as recall, against the false positive rate (FPR).
- **_Precision-Recall Curve_**
  - A graph that plots the precision against the recall for different classification thresholds.

## What is being tracked?

![](https://files.readme.io/4a646d4-qs_monitoring.png ""qs_monitoring.png"")

- **_Decisions_** - The post-prediction business decisions made as a result of the model output. Decisions are calculated before [client.publish_event()](ref:clientpublish_event) (they''re not inferred by Fiddler). For binary classification models, a decision is usually determined using a threshold. For multi-class classification models, it''s usually determined using the argmax value of the model outputs.

- **_Performance metrics_**
  1. For binary classification models:
     - Accuracy
     - True Positive Rate/Recall
     - False Positive Rate
     - Precision
     - F1 Score
     - AUC
     - AUROC
     - Binary Cross Entropy
     - Geometric Mean
     - Calibrated Threshold
     - Data Count
     - Expected Calibration Error
  2. For multi-class classification models:
     - Accuracy
     - Log loss
  3. For regression models:
     - Coefficient of determination (R-squared)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
     - Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WMAPE)
  4. For ranking models:
     - Mean Average Precision (MAP)—for binary relevance ranking only
     - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

If you need to update a model artifact already uploaded in Fiddler, you can use the `client.update_model_artifact` function. This allows you to replace a surrogate model or your own uploaded model.

Once you have prepared the [model artifacts directory](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates), you can update your model using [client.update_model_artifact](ref:clientupdate_model_artifact)

```python
PROJECT_ID = ''example_project''
MODEL_ID = ''example_model''

If you need to update a model artifact already uploaded in Fiddler, you can use the `client.update_model_artifact` function. This allows you to replace a surrogate model or your own uploaded model.

Once you have prepared the [model artifacts directory](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates), you can update your model using [client.update_model_artifact](ref:clientupdate_model_artifact)

```python
PROJECT_ID = ''example_project''
MODEL_ID = ''example_model''
MODEL_ARTIFACTS_DIR = Path(''model/'')

client.update_model_artifact(
    artifact_dir=MODEL_ARTIFACTS_DIR,
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,

This guide will walk you through the basic steps required to onboard a model in Fiddler with its model artifact.  When Fiddler is provided with the actual model artifact, it can produce high-fidelity explanations. In contrast, models within Fiddler that use a surrogate model or no model artifact at all provide approximative explainability or no explainability at all.

This [integration](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-machine-learning-models-fiddler/) enables you to centralize your monitoring of ML models and the applications that utilize them within one unified platform.

## Integrating Fiddler with Datadog

Instructions for integrating Fiddler with Datadog can be found on the ""Integrations"" section of your Datadog console.  Simply search for ""Fiddler"" and follow the installation instructions provided on the ""Configure"" tab.  Please reach out to [support@fiddler.ai](mailto:support@fiddler.ai) with any issues or questions.

**Projects** represent your organization''s distinct AI applications or use cases. Within Fiddler, Projects house all the **Models** specific to a given application, and thus serve as a jumping-off point for the majority of Fiddler’s model monitoring and explainability features.

Go ahead and click on the _Lending project_ to navigate to the Project Overview page.

![](https://files.readme.io/b008f03-image.png)

Here you can see a list of the models contained within the Lending project, as well as a project dashboard to which analyze charts can be pinned. Go ahead and click the “logreg-all” model.

![](https://files.readme.io/f3e024d-image.png)

From the Model Overview page, you can view details about the model: its metadata (schema), the files in its model directory, and its features, which are sorted by impact (the degree to which each feature influences the model’s prediction score).

You can then navigate to the platform''s core monitoring and explainability capabilities. These include:

- **_Monitor_** — Track and configure alerts on your model’s performance, data drift, data integrity, and overall service metrics. Read the [Monitoring](doc:monitoring-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Analyze_** — Analyze the behavior of your model in aggregate or with respect to specific segments of your population. Read the [Analytics](doc:analytics-ui) documentation for more details.
- **_Explain_** — Generate “point” or prediction-level explanations on your training or production data for insight into how each model decision was made. Read the [Explainability](doc:explainability-platform) documentation for more details.
- **_Evaluate_** — View your model’s performance on its training and test sets for quick validation prior to deployment. Read the [Evaluation](doc:evaluation-ui) documentation for more details.

Event publication is the process of sending your model''s prediction logs, or events, to the Fiddler platform.  Using the [Fiddler Client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), events can be published in batch or streaming mode.  Using these events, Fiddler will calculate metrics around feature drift, prediction drift, and model performance.  These events are also stored in Fiddler to allow for ad hoc segment analysis.  Please read the sections that follow to learn more about how to use the Fiddler Client for event publication.  Document:  ---

Please refer [our documentation](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/alerts) for more information on Alert Rules. 

---
  
Let''s set up a few Alert Rules.

The following API call sets up a Data Integrity type rule which triggers an email notification when published events have 2 or more range violations in any 1 day bin for the ```numofproducts``` column.


```python
notifications_config = client.build_notifications_config(
    emails = ""name@google.com"",
)

client.add_alert_rule(
    name = ""Bank Churn Range Violation Alert1"",
    project_id = PROJECT_ID,
    model_id = MODEL_ID,
    alert_type = fdl.AlertType.DATA_INTEGRITY,
    metric = fdl.Metric.RANGE_VIOLATION,
    bin_size = fdl.BinSize.ONE_DAY, 
    compare_to = fdl.CompareTo.RAW_VALUE,
    #compare_period = None,
    priority = fdl.Priority.HIGH,
    warning_threshold = 2,
    critical_threshold = 3,
    condition = fdl.AlertCondition.GREATER,
    column = ""numofproducts"",
    notifications_config = notifications_config
)
```

The following API call sets up a Performance type rule which triggers an email notification when precision metric is 5% higher than that from 1 hr bin one day ago.


```python
notifications_config = client.build_notifications_config(
    emails = ""name@google.com"",
)
client.add_alert_rule(
    name = ""Bank Churn Performance Alert"",
    project_id = PROJECT_ID,
    model_id = MODEL_ID,
    alert_type = fdl.AlertType.PERFORMANCE,
    metric = fdl.Metric.PRECISION,
    bin_size = fdl.BinSize.ONE_HOUR, 
    compare_to = fdl.CompareTo.TIME_PERIOD,
    compare_period = fdl.ComparePeriod.ONE_DAY,
    warning_threshold = 0.05,
    critical_threshold = 0.1,
    condition = fdl.AlertCondition.GREATER,
    priority = fdl.Priority.HIGH,
    notifications_config = notifications_config
)
```

## 6. Publish production events

Information about your model is added to Fiddler and now it''s time to start publishing some production data!  
Fiddler will **monitor this data and compare it to your baseline to generate powerful insights into how your model is behaving**.


---


Each record sent to Fiddler is called **an event**.
  
Let''s load in some sample events from a CSV file.


```python
PATH_TO_EVENTS_CSV = ''https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiddler-labs/fiddler-examples/main/quickstart/data/churn_events.csv''

production_df = pd.read_csv(PATH_TO_EVENTS_CSV)

# Shift the timestamps of the production events to be as recent as today 
production_df[''timestamp''] = production_df[''timestamp''] + (int(time.time() * 1000) - production_df[''timestamp''].max())
```


```python
print(production_df[''timestamp''])
```

You can use the client''s `publish_events_batch` function to start pumping data into Fiddler!
  
*Just include:*
1. The DataFrame containing your events
2. The name of the column containing event timestamps


```python
client.publish_events_batch(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    batch_source=production_df,
    timestamp_field=''timestamp'',
    id_field=''customer_id'' # Optional
)
```

## 7. Get insights
  
Now just head to your Fiddler URL and start getting enhanced observability into your model''s performance.

Run the  Document:  slug: ""quick-start"" absolute** or **relative** values.

A model is a **representation of your machine learning model**. Each model must have an associated dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring, explainability, and fairness capabilities.

You **do not need to upload your model artifact in order to onboard your model**, but doing so will significantly improve the quality of explanations generated by Fiddler.  Document:  ---

For uploading your artifact model, refer to the table above and increase the memory number, depending on your model framework and complexity. Surrogate models use lightgbm framework. 

For example, an NLP model for a TEXT input might need memory set at 1024 or higher and CPU at 1000.

Supervised machine learning involves identifying a predictive task, finding data to enable that task, and building a model using that data. Fiddler captures this workflow with project, dataset, and model entities.

## Projects

A project represents a machine learning task (e.g. predicting house prices, assessing creditworthiness, or detecting fraud).

A project can contain one or more models for the ML task (e.g. LinearRegression-HousePredict, RandomForest-HousePredict).

Create a project by clicking on **Projects** and then clicking on **Add Project**.

![](https://files.readme.io/8e4b429-Add_project_0710.png ""Add_project_0710.png"")

- **_Create New Project_** — A window will pop up where you can enter the project name and click **Create**. Once the project is created, it will be displayed on the projects page.

You can access your projects from the Projects Page.

      ],
      ""align"": ""center"",
      ""caption"": ""Projects Page on Fiddler UI""
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

## Datasets

A dataset in Fiddler is a data table containing features, model outputs, and a target for machine learning models. Optionally, you can also upload metadata and “decision” columns, which can be used to segment the dataset for analyses, track business decisions, and work as protected attributes in bias-related workflows. For more details refer to [Datasets](doc:project-architecture#datasets) in the Platform Guide.

Once you click on a particular project, you will be able to see if there are any datasets associated with the project. For example, the bank_churn project, in the following screenshot, has the bank_churn dataset. [Datasets are uploaded via the Fiddler client](ref:clientupload_dataset). 

![](https://files.readme.io/3fa7700-Screenshot_2022-12-27_at_1.05.05_PM.png)

## Models

A model in Fiddler represents a machine learning model. A project will have one or more models for the ML task (e.g. a project to predict house prices might contain LinearRegression-HousePredict and RandomForest-HousePredict). For further details refer to the [Models](doc:project-architecture#models) section in the Platform Guide.

![](https://files.readme.io/e151df5-Model_Dashboard.png ""Model_Dashboard.png"")

### Model Artifacts

At its most basic level, a model in Fiddler is simply a directory that contains [model artifacts](doc:artifacts-and-surrogates) such as:

- The model file (e.g. `*.pkl`)
- `package.py`: A wrapper script containing all of the code needed to standardize the execution of the model.

Fiddler enables users to set up alert rules to track a model''s health and performance over time. Fiddler alerts also enable users to dig into triggered alerts and perform root cause analysis to discover what is causing a model to degrade. Users can set up alerts using both the [Fiddler UI](doc:alerts-ui) and the [Fiddler API Client](doc:alerts-client).

## Supported Metric Types

You can get alerts for the following metrics:

- [**Data Drift**](doc:data-drift)  — Predictions and all features
  - Model performance can be poor if models trained on a specific dataset encounter different data in production.
- [**Performance**](doc:performance) 
  - Model performance tells us how well a model is doing on its task. A poorly performing model can have significant business implications.
- [**Data Integrity**](doc:data-integrity)  — All features
  - There are three types of violations that can occur at model inference: missing feature values, type mismatches (e.g. sending a float input for a categorical feature type) or range mismatches (e.g. sending an unknown US State for a State categorical feature).
- [**Service Metrics**](doc:traffic-platform) 
  - The volume of traffic received by the model over time that informs us of the overall system health.

## Supported Comparison Types

You have two options for deciding when to be alerted:

1. **Absolute** — Compare the metric to an absolute value
   1. e.g. if traffic for a given hour is less than 1000, then alert.
2. **Relative** — Compare the metric to a previous time period
   1. e.g. if traffic is down 10% or more than it was at the same time one week ago, then alert.

You can set the alert threshold in either case.

## Alert Rule Priority

Whether you''re setting up an alert rule to keep tabs on a model in a test environment, or data for production scenarios, Fiddler has you covered. Easily set the Alert Rule Priority to indicate the importance of any given Alert Rule. Users can select from Low, Medium, and High priorities. 

## Alert Rule Severity

For additional flexibility, users can now specify up to two threshold values, **Critical** and **Warning** severities. Critical severity is always required when setting up an Alert Rule, but Warning can be optionally set as well.

## Why do we need alerts?

- It’s not possible to manually track all metrics 24/7.
- Sensible alerts are your first line of defense, and they are meant to warn about issues in production.

## What should I do when I receive an alert?

- Click on the link in the email to go to the tab where the alert originated (e.g. Data Drift). 
- Under the Monitoring tab, more information can be obtained from the drill down below the main chart.
- You can also examine the data in the Analyze tab. You can use SQL to slice and dice the data, and use custom visualization tools and operators to make sense of the model’s behavior within the time range under consideration.

## Sample Alert Email

Here''s a sample of an email that''s sent if an alert is triggered:

Whether you''re setting up an alert rule to keep tabs on a model in a test environment, or data for production scenarios, Fiddler has you covered. Easily set the Alert Rule Priority to indicate the importance of any given Alert Rule. Users can select from Low, Medium, and High priorities. 

## Alert Rule Severity

For additional flexibility, users can now specify up to two threshold values, **Critical** and **Warning** severities. Critical severity is always required when setting up an Alert Rule, but Warning can be optionally set as well.

## Why do we need alerts?

- It’s not possible to manually track all metrics 24/7.
- Sensible alerts are your first line of defense, and they are meant to warn about issues in production.

## What should I do when I receive an alert?

- Click on the link in the email to go to the tab where the alert originated (e.g. Data Drift). 
- Under the Monitoring tab, more information can be obtained from the drill down below the main chart.
- You can also examine the data in the Analyze tab. You can use SQL to slice and dice the data, and use custom visualization tools and operators to make sense of the model’s behavior within the time range under consideration.

## Sample Alert Email

Here''s a sample of an email that''s sent if an alert is triggered:

2. Monitoring various performance metrics associated with the model
3. Monitoring data integrity issues that could harm the model performance
4. Investigating the features which have drifted/ compromised and analyzing them to mitigate the issue
5. Performing a root cause analysis to identify the exact cause and fix it
6. Diving into point explanations to identify how much the issue has an impact on a particular data point
7. Setting up alerts to make sure the issue does not happen again

We discovered there was an issue with the ‘Category’ column, wherein a new value was discovered in the production data. This led to the performance drop in the data likely due to the range violation. We suggest two steps to mitigate this issue:

1. Setting up ‘alerts’ to identify similar issues in data integrity
2. Retraining the ML model after including the new data (with the ground truth labels) to teach the model of the new values  Document:  slug: ""fraud-detection""

1. **Add to dashboard**  
   We can add the chart generated to the dashboard by clicking on **Pin this chart** on the RHS of the Analyze tab. This would help us in monitoring importance aspects of the model.

2. **Add alerts**  
   We can alert users to make sure we are notified the next time there is a performance degradation. For instance, in this example, there was a performance degradation due to range data integrity violation. To mitigate this, we can set up an alert which would notify us in case the percentage range violation exceeds a certain threshold (10% would be a good number in our case). We can also set up alerts on drift values for prediction etc. Check out this [link](doc:alerts-ui) to learn how to set up alerts on Fiddler platform.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model''s behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8e4f81-Tabular_Explain.png ""Tabular_Explain.png"")

A brief tour of the features above:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it''s approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

**Two numbers** accompany each feature’s attribution bar in the UI.  Document:  ---

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations to describe the impact of features in your model. Feature impact and importance can be found in either the Explain or Analyze tab.

Global explanations are available in the UI for **structured (tabular)** and **natural language (NLP)** models, for both classification and regression. They are also supported via API using the Fiddler Python package. Global explanations are available for both production and dataset queries.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation tool shows the impact/importance of the features in the model.

Two global explanation methods are available:

- **_Feature impact_** — Gives the average absolute change in the model prediction when a feature is randomly ablated (removed).
- **_Feature importance_** — Gives the average change in loss when a feature is randomly ablated.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Global Explanation performs ablation feature impact on a collection of text samples, determining which words have the most impact on the prediction.

[^1]\: _Join our [community Slack](https://www.fiddler.ai/slackinvite) to ask any questions_","Explainability refers to the ability to understand and interpret the behavior of a machine learning model. Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain a model''s behavior. Fiddler supports two types of explanations: point explanations and global explanations.

Point explanations allow you to understand how a specific prediction is made by attributing the prediction to individual input features. This can be done at an individual prediction level in the Explain tab, at a model level in the Analyze tab, or within the monitoring context in the Monitor tab. Point explanations are available for both structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models.

Global explanations, on the other hand, describe the impact of features in a model. They provide information about the importance of features in the model''s predictions. Global explanations are available for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models, for both classification and regression. They can be found in the Explain or Analyze tab.

Approximate Shapley value methods can be used to explain nearly any model, since you only need to be able to ask the model for predictions at a variety of positions in the feature space.

**Integrated Gradients**

Another additive attribution method: the Integrated Gradients method.

For models whose prediction is continuous and piecewise differentiable in the feature space, it can be useful to provide additional information through the gradient (slope vector) of a prediction.

Fiddler supports Integrated Gradients (IG)[<sup>\[4\]</sup>](#references). In this method, an approximate integral tabulates components of the slope along a linear path from baseline to explain-point, and attributes them to respective input features. This has several advantages:

1. For models with very high dimensional feature volumes (e.g. images, text), where differentiable deep-learning models typically excel, this method can be very performant (O(N) vs. the O(2^n) of the Shapley methods)
2. Attributions can be computed for intermediate layers within the model, providing fine-grained model diagnostics. This is naturally extensible to models with hybrid and multimodal inputs.
3. In comparison to local gradients and saliency methods, the IG path integral samples the large-scale behavior of the model and is resistant to amplifying noise in the possibly saturated region around the explain-point.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance.

## What do I do next with this information?

- High drift can occur as a result of _data integrity issues_ (bugs in the data pipeline), or as a result of _an actual change in the distribution of data_ due to external factors (e.g. a dip in income due to COVID). The former is more in our control to solve directly. The latter may not be solvable directly, but can serve as an indicator that further investigation (and possible retraining) may be needed.
- You can drill down deeper into the data by examining it in the Analyze tab. 

The image below shows how to open the Analyze view for a specific feature and time range identified in the Data Drift page.

![](https://files.readme.io/8a699e1-Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png ""Monitor_DDrift_Analyze.png"")

This will bring you to the Analyze tab, where you can then use SQL to slice and dice the data.  You can then apply visualizations upon these slices to analyze the model’s behavior.

# How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

One approach for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs has on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

**Introduction**

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model''s behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

A brief tour of the features above:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it''s approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

## Point Explanation Methods: How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

**Introduction**

One strategy for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs have on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

Each feature is assigned a fraction of the prediction difference for which it is responsible. This fraction is called the feature attribution, and it’s what we show in our explanations.

Additive attribution methods have the following characteristics:

- The sum of feature attributions always equals the prediction difference.
- Features that have no effect on a model’s prediction receive a feature attribution of zero.
- Features that have the identical effect receive the same attribution.
- Features with mutual information share the attribution for any effect that information has on the prediction.

Additionally, each of these methods takes into account interactions between the features (e.g. two features that have no effect individually but in combination change the model output). This is explicitly built into the Shapley value formalism, and is captured in the path integral over gradients in Integrated Gradients.

**Shapley Values and their Approximation**

The Shapley value[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references) (proposed by Lloyd Shapley in 1953) is one way to derive feature attributions. Shapley values distribute  Document:  slug: ""point-explainability""  _The first number_ is the **attribution**.

The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

Each feature is assigned a fraction of the prediction difference for which it is responsible. This fraction is called the feature attribution, and it’s what we show in our explanations.

Additive attribution methods have the following characteristics:

- The sum of feature attributions always equals the prediction difference.
- Features that have no effect on a model’s prediction receive a feature attribution of zero.
- Features that have the identical effect receive the same attribution.
- Features with mutual information share the attribution for any effect that information has on the prediction.

Additionally, each of these methods takes into account interactions between the features (e.g. two features that have no effect individually but in combination change the model output). This is explicitly built into the Shapley value formalism, and is captured in the path integral over gradients in Integrated Gradients.

**Shapley Values and their Approximation**

The Shapley value[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references) (proposed by Lloyd Shapley in 1953) is one way to derive feature attributions. Shapley values  Document:  slug: ""point-explainability-platform"" - _The first number_ is the **attribution**. The sum of these values over all features will always equal the difference between the model prediction and a baseline prediction value.

- _The second number_, the percentage in parentheses, is the **feature attribution divided by the sum of the absolute values of all the feature attributions**. This provides an easy to compare, relative measure of feature strength and directionality (notice that negative attributions have negative percentages) and is bounded by ±100%.

> 📘 Info
> 
> An input box labeled **“Top N”** controls how many attributions are visible at once.  If the values don’t add up as described above, it’s likely that weaker attributions are being filtered-out by this control.

Finally, it’s important to note that **feature attributions combine model behavior with characteristics of the data distribution**.

## Language (NLP) Models

For language models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation provides the word-level impact on the prediction score when using perturbative methods (SHAP and Fiddler); for the Integrated Gradients method, tokenization can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script. The explanations are interactive—edit the text, and the explanation updates immediately.

## Point Explanation Methods: How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

**Introduction**

One strategy for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs have on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

Fiddler provides powerful visualizations that can explain your model''s behavior. These explanations can be queried at an individual prediction level in the **Explain** tab, at a model level in the **Analyze** tab or within the monitoring context in the **Monitor** tab.

Explanations are available in the UI for structured (tabular) and natural language (NLP) models. They are also supported via API using the [fiddler-client](https://pypi.org/project/fiddler-client/) Python package. Explanations are available for both production and baseline queries.

Fiddler’s explanations are interactive — you can change feature inputs and immediately view an updated prediction and explanation. We have productized several popular **explanation methods** to work fast and at scale:

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

## Tabular Models

For tabular models, Fiddler’s Point Explanation tool shows how any given model prediction can be attributed to its individual input features.

The following is an example of an explanation for a model predicting the likelihood of customer churn:

![](https://files.readme.io/b8e4f81-Tabular_Explain.png ""Tabular_Explain.png"")

A brief tour of the features above:

- **_Explanation Method_**: The explanation method is selected from the **Explanation Type** dropdown.

- **_Input Vector_**: The far left column contains the input vector. Each input can be adjusted.

- **_Model Prediction_**: The box in the upper-left shows the model’s prediction for this input vector.

  - If the model produces multiple outputs (e.g. probabilities in a multiclass classifier), you can click on the prediction field to select and explain any of the output components. This can be particularly useful when diagnosing misclassified examples.

- **_Feature Attributions_**: The colored bars on the right represent how the prediction is attributed to the individual feature inputs.

  - A positive value (blue bar) indicates a feature is responsible for driving the prediction in the positive direction.
  - A negative value (red bar) is responsible for driving the prediction in a negative direction.

- **_Baseline Prediction_**: The thin colored line just above the bars shows the difference between the baseline prediction and the model prediction. The specifics of the baseline calculation vary with the explanation method, but usually it''s approximately the mean prediction of the training/reference data distribution (i.e. the dataset specified when importing the model into Fiddler). The baseline prediction represents a typical model prediction.

# How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

One approach for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs has on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

# How to Quantify Prediction Impact of a Feature?

One approach for explaining the prediction of a machine learning model is to measure the influence that each of its inputs has on the prediction made. This is called Feature Impact.

- SHAP and Fiddler SHAP, using Kernel SHAP implementations, are game-theory based methods. They work for all models, because they only require the ability to ask a model for predictions.
- Integrated Gradients, which is particularly performant for deep learning models with a large number of inputs. It requires the model’s prediction to be mathematically differentiable, and a prediction gradient must be made available to Fiddler.
- Tree SHAP, is not enabled by default but can be used for Tree-based model. This is a faster and model-specific method to approximate Shapley values.

These methods are discussed in more detail below.

In addition to the previous out of the box explanation methods, Fiddler allows to bring your own explanation method. This can be customized in your model’s `package.py` wrapper script.

**Introduction**

To measure Feature Impact, **additive attribution methods** can be quite powerful. Fiddler includes:

- **SHAP** and **Fiddler SHAP**, which require only the ability to ask a model for predictions, and are thus suitable across all types of models; no knowledge of the model implementation is necessary.
- **Integrated Gradients**, a method that takes advantage of the gradient vector of the prediction, which is typically available in deep learning models, to efficiently explain complex models with large input dimensionality.

**Additive Attributions**

To explain a prediction with an additive attribution method, we look at how individual features contribute to the _prediction difference_. The prediction difference is a comparison between the prediction as a point in feature space (we refer to this as the _explain-point_), and a counterfactual baseline position (or a distribution of positions), representing an uninteresting or typical model inference.

Each feature is assigned a fraction of the prediction difference for which it is responsible. This fraction is called the feature attribution, and it’s what we show in our explanations.

Additive attribution methods have the following characteristics:

- The sum of feature attributions always equals the prediction difference.
- Features that have no effect on a model’s prediction receive a feature attribution of zero.
- Features that have the identical effect receive the same attribution.
- Features with mutual information share the attribution for any effect that information has on the prediction.

Additionally, each of these methods takes into account interactions between the features (e.g. two features that have no effect individually but in combination change the model output). This is explicitly built into the Shapley value formalism, and is captured in the path integral over gradients in Integrated Gradients.
