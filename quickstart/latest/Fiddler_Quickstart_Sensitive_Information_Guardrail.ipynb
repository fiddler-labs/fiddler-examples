        "\n",
        "## Goal\n",
        "Learn how to detect and protect sensitive information in text data using Fiddler's Sensitive Information Guardrail, including PII, PHI, and custom entity detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Sensitive Information Guardrail Observability\n",
        "The [Sensitive Information Guardrail](https://docs.fiddler.ai/product-guide/llm-monitoring/guardrails#fast-personally-identifiable-information-pii-guardrails) provides comprehensive protection against data leakage by detecting and flagging sensitive information across multiple categories. This guardrail helps organizations maintain compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA by identifying personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and custom-defined sensitive entities. The guardrail integrates seamlessly with Fiddler's broader platform, enabling comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and compliance reporting for sensitive information detection across your AI and ML applications and data pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key capabilities include real-time detection of 35+ PII entity types, 7 PHI entity types, and user-defined custom entities. The guardrail operates with high performance, using a 0.1 confidence threshold and can process up to 1,024 entities per request, making it suitable for both real-time applications and batch processing workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "## About Fiddler\n",
        "Fiddler is the all-in-one AI Observability and Security platform for responsible AI. Monitoring and analytics capabilities provide a common language, centralized controls, and actionable insights to operationalize production ML models, GenAI, AI agents, and LLM applications with trust. An integral part of the platform, the Fiddler Trust Service provides quality and moderation controls for LLM applications. Powered by cost-effective, task-specific, and scalable Fiddler-developed trust models—including cloud and VPC deployments for secure environments—it delivers the fastest guardrails in the industry. Fortune 500 organizations utilize Fiddler to scale LLM and ML deployments, delivering high-performance AI, reducing costs, and ensuring responsible governance."

        "\n",
        "1. **Flexible Configuration**: Choose from PII, PHI, or custom entities based on your use case\n",
        "2. **High Performance**: 0.1 confidence threshold with top-1024 entity filtering\n",
        "3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 35 PII + 7 PHI entity types supported\n",
        "4. **Easy Integration**: Simple API calls with configurable parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🛡️ Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Start with defaults**: Use PII detection first, then add PHI/custom as needed\n",
        "- **Batch processing**: Process multiple texts efficiently for large datasets\n",
        "- **Error handling**: Implement retry logic for production systems\n",
        "- **Monitor performance**: Track latency and detection rates\n",
        "- **Custom entities**: Define organization-specific sensitive data types\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔗 Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integrate into your data pipelines\n",
        "- Set up monitoring and alerting\n",
        "- Customize entity lists for your domain\n",
        "- Implement automated redaction workflows\n",
        "- Establish compliance reporting\n",
