    "# Fiddler Simple Monitoring Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides a comprehensive tour of Fiddler's monitoring capabilities, demonstrating how to onboard a binary classification model and then layer on advanced features like proactive alerts, custom business metrics, user-defined segments, and multiple baseline strategies. üó∫Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Dive Into Fiddler's Monitoring and Analytic Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a comprehensive introduction to Fiddler's powerful monitoring toolkit, using a customer churn model as the example. After walking through the fundamental steps of onboarding a binary classification model, the guide demonstrates how to build a robust, production-grade monitoring setup. You'll learn how to configure proactive alerts for data quality and performance, translate model metrics into business impact with custom metrics, isolate specific cohorts with segments, and implement both static and rolling baselines for powerful drift analysis. This guide showcases how these features work together to provide a complete view of your model's health.\n",
