# Fiddler Sensitive Information Guardrail Quick Start Guide

## What You'll Learn

This interactive notebook demonstrates comprehensive sensitive information detection through practical examples of PII, PHI, and custom entity identification.

**Key Topics Covered:**
* Real-time detection of 35+ PII entity types (personal, financial, digital identifiers)
* Healthcare data protection with 7 PHI entity types (medical information, health insurance)
* Custom entity configuration for organization-specific sensitive data
* Batch processing workflows for large-scale data analysis
* Production deployment best practices and compliance reporting

## Interactive Tutorial

The notebook walks through detecting sensitive information across different data types, from basic PII detection to advanced custom entity configuration and batch processing workflows.
